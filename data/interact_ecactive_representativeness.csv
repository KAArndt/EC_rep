The station is situated within the National Park of North and Northeast Greenland, the largest national park in the World. The military station has an average elevation of 30 m a.s.l. with a gentle slope to the coast. A 2 km gravel/ice runway, which is kept open year round, is the only gateway to Station Nord. The station acts as a gateway to the northern part of the National Park of North and Northeast Greenland. ","The station is situated in the High Arctic, and the surroundings are mainly Polar Desert. The area has continuous permafrost, and a continuous snow cover characterise the area for almost ten month per year. The mean annual temperature is c. -17 °C and the mean annual precipitation is c. 190 mm. Mean monthly temperature is -31 °C during the coldest month (February) and 3 °C during the warmest month (July). The Princess Ingeborgs Peninsula plain consists of Quaternary raised marine silt, beach shingle, and glacial deposits. The Quaternary deposits are underlain by rocks of Permian age. Station Nord is situated very close to the Polar Sea, and the sea-ice conditions in the area are generally severe with heavy sea-ice throughout the year. Consequently, ships cannot service Station Nord. Provide access to another Greenland with unique arctic ecosystems including species like ivory ant geese, whales, and muskox.","Station Nord was opened in 1952 as a Danish weather station and emergency runway, and it remained open until 1972, when it was closed and left unused, until the Danish military acquired it in 1975. The research activities at Station Nord have been ongoing since the 1970s with measurement activities being intensified since 1990. The research facilities were established by the Danish National Environmental Research Institute (NERI), which is now merged with Aarhus University. In 2014, the research facilities at Station Nord were substantially upgraded based on a major grant from the Danish private fund, Villum Foundation. VRS now consists of three buildings, including a main building with laboratories and accommodation facilities, an atmospheric/air observatory situated two km outside Station Nord, and a garage with storage facilities. The station can house 14 scientists at a time. The total area under roof is c. 600 m2.","Once the new station is fully operating, a database will be established for storage of all kind of scientific data. At present only atmospheric data are stored in a database maintained by Aarhus University. Meteorological and atmospheric chemical data are reported to EMEP (European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme), and AMAP (Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme) and will in the future also be reported to WMO-GAW (World Meteorological Organisation, Global Atmosphere Watch).

It is located in a transition zone where the northern extent of the boreal forest meets the southern edge of the arctic tundra; it is also near the Churchill River, where freshwater enters the marine ecosystem of Hudson Bay (58°44N, 94°49W). This convergence of ecosystems (forest, tundra, taiga, freshwater, estuary and marine) provides an incredibly wide array of representative environments for study. The station serves Canadian universities, government agencies and international organisations. ","Churchill, Manitoba, Canada is located on the west shore of Hudson Bay, 110 kilometres from the Manitoba-Nunavut. It is most famous for the many polar bears that move toward the shore from inland in the autumn, leading to the nickname ""Polar Bear Capital of the World"" that has helped its growing tourism industry. The landscape around Churchill is influenced by shallow soils caused by a combination of subsurface permafrost and bedrock formations.  Churchill is also located at the northern edge of the Hudson Bay Lowland ecoregion. Churchill has a subarctic climate with long very cold winters, and short, cool to mild summers. The prevailing wind direction is from the northwest. Churchill's winters are colder than a location at a latitude of 58 degrees north should warrant, given its coastal location. The shallow Hudson Bay freezes, eliminating any maritime moderation","Established in 1976, the mission of the CNSC is to understand and sustain the north. This vision is implemented through the promotion of northern research, developing and supporting educational opportunities, and serving as a vehicle for dialogue about northern issues. The CNSC operates year-round with nine full-time year-round staff and 4-10 part-time and seasonal employees. With over 40 years of experience in arctic research, including science outreach, the Centre is well positioned to continue our operations in the Subarctic. The Centre operates primarily on a fee-for-services basis with less than 10% of its annual $1.5 million budget coming directly from government grants or subsidies. We deliver informal adult learning vacations focused on polar bears, birding, and northern lights. Institutionally, the CNSC has over 7,000 members from all Canadian provinces, US States, and over 50 other countries. ","Major research conducted through the CNSC include auroral research, climate change, climatology, greenhouse gas emissions, inland water quality, marine ecosystems, northern ecology, peatland and treeline dynamics, snow pack dynamics, and wildlife management. The centre facilitates the work of between 100 and 175 researchers annually. In addition, the centre host citizen science research programs funded by Earthwatch Institute under the Climate Change at the Arctics Edge programme.","The nearest community is the Town of Churchill.  It is located 23 km away from the CNSC. Churchill has a population of 899 people and is located on the west coast of Hudson Bay in Manitoba. The town of Churchill grew from a gathering point (circa 4000 B.P.) to a remote outpost of the Hudson Bay Company on the west side of the Churchill River to a bustling seaport with the construction of the Hudson Bay Railroad and Port of Churchill on the east side of the river in the late 1920s. Through much of the 1950s and 1960s, the town was a thriving military community servicing Fort Churchill and the Churchill Research Range. Churchills economy today is based on four main pillars: tourism, transportation, health and research.
The community also possesses a rich cultural history with the intersection of three aboriginal peoples (the Caribou Inuit, the Sayisi-Dene and the Maskêkô-winniwak or Swampy Cree) and, following the establishment of a Hudson Bay trading post, become home to a significant Métis population. European settlers, the Canadian and US military, and currently a temporary labour force with ties stretching to Australia and Southeast Asia round out the population of Churchill. The connection with the land and the confluence of the marine, tundra and boreal biomes is strong in the region and has long attracted travellers. ","Access to the station is by rail (using VIA Rail Canada from Winnipeg or Thompson, Manitoba) or by air (using Calm Air from Winnipeg or Thompson, Manitoba).  Rail travel from Winnipeg is 36 hours whereas a flight is 2 hours. Freight can be shipped to Churchill using Gardewine North and arrives once per week via freight train or can be brought in by air transport. Field transportation once in Churchill can be done with vehicles using the approximately 50 km of road network in the region. More remote use can be accomplished by ATV, snowmobile or helicopter. Camping and long-distance hiking is not recommended due to the presence of polar bears in the region.

It belongs to the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous District. The nearest larger town is Salekhard (less than 20 km to the Southeast). Labytnangi is situated on the bank of the Ob River  one of the largest rivers in the world.","Labytnangi (c. 25000 inhabitants) is situated in the forest-tundra zone of the Yamal Peninsula. The taiga zone begins more than ten kilometers up the Ob River, and the shrubby tundra zone begins ten kilometers to the north. The Yamal Peninsula is a bio-geographical interesting area supporting the most eastern populations of many European animal species, and the most westerly populations of many Siberian species. Both taiga and tundra animals species are present in the area. The Polar Ural Mountains are just 50 km west of Labytnangi.","The station was established in 1954, driven by two main aims, i.e. (i) to conduct ecological investigations on a year-round basis, and (ii) to create a logistics base for the core activities of the Institute of Plant and Animal Ecology. The 32000 m2 of station area consists of offices and lab buildings, a garage, and storage for expedition equipment. Telephone, fax, copy machines, and computer with access to the internet are also available. The station can host 20-25 people at a time and a wide variety of field equipment is available for rent. ","Long-term studies on small rodents have been carried out for more than 50 years in different vegetation zones of the Yamal Peninsula. Population dynamics of birds have been monitored since 1970. These long-term studies are backed-up by more extensive studies on vegetation, rodents, and other mammals such as predators (Arctic fox), birds, etc. Labytnangi Ecological Research Station cooperates with a number of international partners. Since 2007, the station has been part of the Norwegian-Russian IPY project Arctic predators. Another project on Satellite tracking of Northern Eurasian Peregrines is undertaken in collaboration with International Wildlife Consultants Ltd. (UK). ","The Yamal-Nenets Autonomous District is one of the largest regions in Russia. It occupies a vast territory of over 750000 km2, and is primarily known for its large deposits of hydrocarbon raw materials. The population of indigenous people (Nenets) is about 37000. Yamal is one of the few places in the world where the traditional way of life is well preserved and about 13000 of the inhabitants still live a traditional nomadic life. Yamals domestic reindeer population exceeds 650000, the largest regional domestic reindeer population in the world.","There is a railway station in Labytnangi with daily trains to Moscow (48 hours trip).

The nearest settlement is Tiksi, located about 115 km to the South-East, and home to c. 5000 inhabitants.","Samoylov Island is situated in the youngest (Holocene) part of the Lena Delta in the zone of continuous permafrost. It covers an area of about 5 km2 and is dominated by wet polygonal tundra, characterised by low-centered ice-wedge polygons. The regional arctic-continental climate allows maximum thaw depths of about 0.5 m. Grasses (Arctophyla fulva, Dupontia fisherii), hydrophytic sedges such as Carex concolor, Carex chordorrhiza, and Carex rariflora, as well as mosses (e.g. Drepanocladus revolvens, Meesia triquetra, and Aulacomnium palustre) dominate the vegetation in the wet polygon centers and on their edges. Mesophytic dwarf shrubs such as Dryas punctata and Salix reptans, forbs (Saxifraga hirculis), and mosses (Hylocomium splendens, Tomentypnum nitens, Aulacomnium turgidum) dominate the polygon rims.","The old wooden station was originally built as a logistics base for the Lena Delta Reserve. After its extension in 2005, it became an official Russian-German research station (in 2006), owned and run by the Lena Delta Reserve (Russia) and the Alfred Wegener Institute. In 2013, a new large modern Russian station, owned and run by the Trofimuk Institute of Petroleum, was officially opened. It replaces the old wooden station, which is, however, still used during the busiest field seasons in summer for additional accommodation and working space. The new station can accommodate up to 25 people year-round. The station building consists of three wings, which include the living areas, scientific laboratories equipped with numerous high-precision instruments, and workshop and storage facilities, respectively. The central part includes kitchen and dining room, conference hall, and recreation areas.","The field work on Samoylov Island and the Lena Delta aims at studying the evolution of the regions geology, climate, hydrology, geomorphology, and biology with a special focus on the interaction of the permafrost ecosystems with recent climate warming and its consequences. Several long-term measurement sites for the monitoring of permafrost conditions, micrometeorology, trace gas exchange, and biology are installed on the island and have been providing important data for the expeditions and the research community as a whole since 1998.

","The area lies in the arctic tundra belt and is characterized by a rolling relief with rocky outcrops raising above the tundra surface. River banks and beaches are dominated by exposed gravel/sand deposits. The altitude of the area is 0 - 40 m a.s.l. The terrain is snow-covered from September to June, small rivers run in depressions between the hills, but are usually dried up by the end of summer. There are no lakes, but some depressions are occupied by polygonal bogs. Permafrost is continuous. Vegetation is dominated by arctic tundra lichens, mosses, sedges, grasses, dwarf willows, and birches. More than 10 shorebird species, six waterfowl species (including the red-breasted goose), and about 10 passerine species nest in the area. Avian and terrestrial predators are represented by the snowy owl, rough-legged buzzard, peregrine falcon, three species of skuas, and arctic fox, lemmings being their basic prey. A few records of muskox and polar bear are known.","The idea of the establishment of Willem Barentsz Biological Station for the memory of the famous Arctic explorer was suggested and initiated by Prof. Evgeny Syroechkovskiy during work of the Arctic Expedition of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) in Taimyr. The building was erected in 1995 with financial support from the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature Management, and Fisheries. Monitoring and research work was initiated in1994 by RAS and since then carried out mainly as cooperation between various Russian and European researchers. The station consists of a large building with bedrooms, a storage room, a kitchen, a toilet, and a few small sheds, which can house up to 15 people. A diesel driven generator and solar power is used for energy supply, and portable diesel or kerosene stoves for heating and cooking.","The station provides unique opportunities for complex monitoring studies aimed at assessment of the long-term dynamics of local numbers of arctic-breeding birds and their nesting success, studies of prey-predator interactions and many other aspects of population biology. Since 1998, a standardised monitoring program for breeding bird, lemming, and predator abundance, as well as nesting success in water birds has been conducted at permanent 4 km2 and 12 km2 sample plots near the station. The long-term studies carried out at the station encompass many aspects of breeding biology of birds, such as arrival and departure dates, breeding phenology, incubation schedules, variation of body condition during incubation, energy requirements and expenditure of chicks and adults, and nesting success. A number of biotic and abiotic factors, including arthropod abundance are also monitored and the vegetation of the areas mapped. Information on the peculiarities and conditions of breeding seasons, and the abundance of birds, lemmings, and predators can be found in the Arctic Bird Database maintained in the framework of the International Breeding Conditions Survey on Arctic Birds (www.arcticbirds.net).

Igarka belongs to the Turukhansk District (Krasnoyarsk Region), and it has 4892 inhabitants (2011).","Igarka is situated at the northwestern part of the Siberian platform, on the western edge of the Tunguska syneclise, one of the largest sedimentary basins of the world. The terrain is glacio-lacustrine plain, about 70 m above the low level of Yenisei River. It is shaped by a variety of permafrost processes, with thermokarst lakes, glacial processes, and pingos. The climate in Igarka is moderate continental, with low winter temperatures and relatively warm summers. The air temperatures are below zero for about 225 days per year, with an average of 70 rainy and 130 snowy days. The area is dominated by the Yenisei River with a mean annual discharge of about 18000 m3/s and a peak flow of about 160000 m3/s. The hydrological network is well developed with typical Western Siberian tundra rivers (Yenisei River left bank) and Eastern Siberian taiga rivers (Yenisei River right bank). Due to permafrost degradation, i.e. ground ice thawing, thermokarst lakes are widely distributed. The Northern taiga with relatively dense taiga forests (dominated by larch, fir, birch, and Siberian pine) is the common vegetation type. In the shrub layer, willow and alder are widespread, together with marsh tea and blueberries. Tundra communities dominate the watershed divides, widely represented by peatbogs covered with carex, cloudberries, cotton grass, and bog moss. The hydroclimatic conditions lead to the formation of different permafrost-affected gley soils.","Since the establishment in 1930, researchers of the Igarka Geo­cryology Laboratory have conducted construction-engineering tests and regional permafrost studies. The research resulted in the development of new construction techniques in permafrost. Intensive studies regarding the physical and mechanical properties of frozen soils, permafrost processes, soil moisture migration in freeze-thaw cycles, and frost heave have been carried out. The use of novel engineering techniques in permafrost in the Soviet-era was strongly linked to the Igarka Research Station. Regional features were also extensively studied: Igarka was used as a base camp for field research in Western and Eastern Siberia, and northern and southern parts of the Krasnoyarsk Region. There is also the Museum of Permafrost (founded in 1965) with frozen tunnels more then 5 m below the surface. ","Nowadays the laboratory is continuing the research in regional and engineering geocryology. Current projects include long-term monitoring of ground ice from the Arctic Circle to Norilsk, a 100 × 100 m grid of the CALM project (Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring), geothermal measurements in a network of boreholes, studies of permafrost processes, permafrost hydrology, water turbidity, and sediment-flux. Methods of construction on high-temperature, ice-rich permafrost and the development of new foundation types are the main engineering research aspects.","The Igarka Geocyrology Labaratory is situated in the town of Igarka. Until the early 1990s the Igarka Timber Factory was the key economic activity in the area, but after the prohibition of lumber floating down the river, the factory was closed, thus undermining the citys economy. Current economy is mainly determined by the river and sea ports, the modern airport, and the service departments of Vankoroil, the Vankor Oil Field operator (the oil field is located about 130 km west of Igarka). ","Igarka can be reached by air and water transport. Igarka Airport has a modern infrastructure and accepts all major aircraft and helicopter types. Flights are performed to Krasnoyarsk and Surgut. Water transport connects Igarka with Dudinka and Norilsk (including Alykel Airport) to the north, and Krasnoyarsk to the south, from early June to early October twice a week.

The most protected sites are generally forested except for areas that have been affected by fire and consequently induced an opening in the forest cover. Landscape features of scientific interest are discontinuous permafrost, thermokarst ponds, palsas, the Boniface River, and the treeline.","The CEN Boniface River Field Station was constructed in 1985 by Professor Serge Payette to conduct research on past treeline and tree growth dynamics in the context of Climate Change. It was upgraded in 2010. Presently, the station is comprised of three individual buildings (one with a shower) that serve primarily as laboratories and a kitchen building. These are powered by solar energy and heated with an oil furnace. Onsite there are two zodiac-style boats. Access to the different research sites is primarily by helicopter or by the Boniface River, which is navigable for some 20 km. Dormitory tents and sleeping bags for researchers and students can be provided by the CEN. Typically, between five and twenty people can be found at the research station during the summer season. ","Meteorological stations installed within the proximity of the research station have been recording the prevailing conditions at the tree limit, including the thermal contrast (air and soil) between tundra and forest environments, since 1988. In addition, tree growth has been measured with the aid of a dozen electronic dendrometers since the summer of 2005. Data available through Nordicana D: www.cen.ulaval.ca/nordicanad/. Topics which are studied at the station include the following, but are not exclusive to these: Vegetation dynamics of a subarctic topo-sequence and the interaction between climate and forest fires, genetic homogeneity in the ecological heterogeneity of Québec subarctic forests in relation to climatic change, black spruce growth as an indicator of Climate Change at the treeline in northern Quebec, origin and dynamics of wooded palsas in the Boniface River region, dwarf birch (Betula glandulosa) densification since 1950, the influence of permafrost on riverine ecosystem dynamics, fire history of the Boniface River region, long black spruce tree-ring chronology, riparian ecosystem dynamics, Holocene evolution of a palsa plateau at the tree limit, and structural dynamics of an ancient spruce lichen woodland at the northern forest limit.",No communities live at or near Boniface River Field Station.

The Kitikmeot hamlets central northern location provides good access to all parts of the Canadian Arctic. The main campus for CHARS is located on the Plateau site in Cambridge Bay, on a slope overlooking the community and the bay. The site is close to other major infrastructure, including the community core.","The climate in the Cambridge Bay area is characterised by a high degree of continentality, demonstrated by a large mean annual temperature range (range of ~45°C) and some of the lowest annual precipitation amounts (100150 mm) encountered in the Canadian Arctic Islands. The annual mean temperature in Cambridge Bay increased by 1.1°C (1961-2010), with most of the warming occurring during the winter months. The bedrock in the Cambridge Bay region and southeastern Victoria Island is Cambrian limestone, and the region hosts a wide range of peri­glacial landforms, e.g. patterned grounds, solifluction lobes, and thermokarst lakes. Permafrost is nearly continuous, with active layers during summer being <1 m. Bioclimatically, the region is part of the Low Arctic, characterised by a moist tundra with low shrubs, forbs, grasses, and cryptogams. The vascular flora consists of c. 150 plant species. The arthropod fauna around Cambridge Bay is relatively diverse and consists of hundreds of insect and spider species. Cambridge Bay is an important fishing area for arctic char and lake trout, and has a small commercial fishery. Southern Victoria Island is an important staging and nesting area for many migratory birds, particularly waders (shorebirds). It also has sizeable populations of caribou, muskox, arctic hare, arctic fox, and arctic wolf.","CHARS was first announced in 2007. Construction of the infrastructure began in 2014 and the station will be operational in time for the 150th anniversary of the Confederation in 2017. It will establish a world-class hub for science and technology in Canadas North that connects a network of regional facilities. The Station will provide a suite of services for Science and Technology (S&T) in Canadas North, including a technology development centre, knowledge sharing centre, and advanced laboratories. The S&T Program will ensure the new infrastructure supports the planned S&T activities. A five-year planning cycle, starting in 2014, was selected to drive the S&T Program to concrete, measurable results, and to address national priorities.","The first 5-year Science and Technology Plan will be phased-in beginning in 2014-2015. This Plan outlines the following shortterm priorities: (i) information preparedness for development; (ii) alternative and renewable energy; (iii) underwater situational awareness; (iv) predicting the impacts of changing ice, permafrost, and snow on shipping, infrastructure, and communities, and (v) infrastructure for development.","Cambridge Bay (Iqaluktuttiaq in Inuinnaqtun, meaning good fishing place) is a hamlet located on Victoria Island in the Kitikmeot Region of Nunavut, Canada.

The CEN secretariat is based at Université Laval, Québec, Canada. ","Bylot Island is located off the northern tip of Baffin Island, Nunavut, Canada. It is accessible through the communities of Pond Inlet (Mittimatalik) and Nanisivik, both found on Northern Baffin Island. The field research covers the south plain of the island (1600 km2), but the research station is located in a large glacial valley at the southwest end of the island (73°08 N, 80°00 W). ","Much of Bylot Island is covered by high mountain peaks and glaciers. The remainder of Bylot Island, and in particular its southern plain, is characterised by extensive low-elevation areas covered by heterogeneous tundra vegetation. The vegetation found in the wetlands is characterised by the presence of sedges, grasses, and many brown moss species. In contrast to the wetlands, dryer areas are found on slopes, hills and elevated terraces surrounding the valley lowlands, as well as on the rims surrounding tundra polygons. The better drained, dryer soils of these habitats allows for distinct plant communities, including forbs, grasses, and shrubs. These uplands, account for 90% of the south plain surface whereas wetlands account for only 10%. The wetlands of the south plain are a habitat of rare plant quality and productivity for an arctic environment. Benefiting from this polar oasis are more than 360 species of plants, 10 mammal species, and 74 bird species. Considered as an important site for many migratory birds, Bylot Island was declared a Migratory Bird Sanctuary in 1965. The south plain holds one of the worlds largest breeding colonies of greater snow geese and the wetlands of the Qarlikturvik valley represent their main brood-rearing site on the island. In addition to the geese, other herbivores are the brown and collared lemmings, Arctic hare, caribou, and rock ptarmigan. The main terrestrial predators are the Arctic fox, long-tailed jaeger, parasitic jaeger, glaucous gull, common raven, and snowy owl. Food web relationships are summarised in Gauthier et al. (2011): Ecoscience 18: 223-235.","The current ecological studies on Bylot Island started in 1988 as a joint collaboration between Université Laval (CEN) and the Canadian Wildlife Service (Quebec region). The initial goals of the study were to initiate a demographic study of the greater snow geese population through a long-term marking program, and to assess the impact of goose grazing on the tundra vegetation. However, over the years, the research program has broadened considerably and now includes many other components of the terrestrial ecosystem. ","A central theme of the research conducted here is trophic interactions in the arctic tundra in relation to environmental changes and greater snow goose ecology, but also long-term monitoring of animal populations, vegetation and climate of the Arctic tundra, impacts of bird populations and Climate Change on lake ecosystems, and geomorphology of ice wedge polygons. Over the years, the Bylot Island research project has grown into one of the largest and longest ecological studies in Nunavut. Established in 2001, Sirmilik National Park encompasses most of Bylot Island, except for a few pockets that are Inuit-owned lands. Covering an area of 22000 km2, this park extends to the northern part of Baffin Island. Sirmilik (which means place of glaciers in Inuktitut) reflects the complex of glaciers and ice caps covering most of Bylot Island. Extensive climate data records are available upon request.

Various habitats can be accessed within walking distance in the study area, i.e. sandy beaches, waterlogged tundra, seepages, dry tundra, bird cliffs, lakes, snow-melt and glacial streams, glaciers, etc. Rich wildlife, incl. gulls, kittiwakes, terns, barnacle geese, eiders, reindeer, arctic foxes, and polar bears are present as well.","The station in Longyaerbyen was established in 2013. Accommodation is available for up to 16 people, and the station further includes laboratories for standard laboratory work. During the summer season, a field camp located ca. 6 km north of the settlement, Pyramiden, is used. The huts can accommodate up to 12 persons and are equipped with a small laboratory, kitchen, and shared bedrooms. Communication is ensured with VHF radios and satellite phones. Three zodiacs are used for transportation in the Billefjorden area. From 2015 a 15 m motor-sailer (for up to 10 persons, four overnight) will be available.","Research mainly focuses on biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics. Relatively long research records on plant ecology, phycology, parasitology, and bioclimatology exist. Today, studies on geomorphology and hydrology are developing in the area. Regular meteorological measurements were established in 2007.","The station is located in Longyearbyen with a predominantly Norwegian population of c. 2100 inhabitants. Historically, the population was employed in fishery, hunting, and whaling, later in the coal mining industry. Today, tourism is becoming the main business. The field camp is near the old mining town of Pyramiden, an area with strong Russian influence.","There are regular commercial flights to Longyearbyen (3 hours from Oslo). To reach the field camp, local cruising companies organise tourist trips to Pyramiden approximately 5 km from the field camp. It usually takes 5-6 hours to reach Pyramiden from Longyearbyen. There is also the possibility of renting a boat in Longyearbyen from a private company. Reaching the station in a rubber boat requires good weather conditions and calm sea. Distance from Logyearbyen is c. 60 km by boat.",http://polar.prf.jcu.cz/station.htm ,Svalbard/Czech Republic,"2014 LYR, 2015 PET, 2016 CLI","LYR year-round, PET 7-9, CLI 5-11",No  ,YES,https://www.researchinsvalbard.no/,"University of South Bohemia, Czech Republic ",Government,Faculty of Science,"University of South Bohemia, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic, czechpolar@gmail.com ",https://www.prf.jcu.cz/en, , ,"LYR - 78°13'23.5""N 15°39'32.2""E, PET - 78°41'08.3""N 16°27'27.7""E ",78.223194,15.658944,NA,"LYR - 2 m a.s.l., PET - 1 m a.s.l.",0 m a.s.l.,1000 m a.s.l.,"LYR - Longyearbyen (2116 inhabitants)

The PEARL Ridge Laboratory building is owned and maintained by Environment Canada and the 0PAL and SAFIRE buildings are owned and maintained by the University of Toronto. Research equipment in the buildings is owned by various university and government organisations.,"PEARL is located adjacent to the Environment Canada Weather Station at Eureka, Nunavut, Canada. PEARL operates three facilities: (i) The PEARL Ridge Laboratory (80°03 N, 86°24 W, 610 m a.s.l.), (ii) the Zero-Altitude PEARL Auxiliary Laboratory (0PAL) (79°59 N, 85°56 W, 10 m a.s.l.), and (iii) the Surface and Atmospheric Flux, Irradiance, Radiation Extension Site (SAFIRE) (79°59 N, 85°48 W, 73 m a.s.l.). The area is a land reserve of the Federal government under Environment Canada. The station is situated on the shores of Slidre Fjord. There is no local permanent settlement in the area.","The area around PEARL is an arctic desert. The whole area is underlain by permafrost which is exposed in places. The micro-climate is exceptionally mild for this latitude (maximum temperature: 20 °C, minimum temperature: -55 °C). Wildlife includes wolves, muskox, arctic fox, and some caribou as well as migratory birds.","The Weather Station at the site has operated for over 60 years. The first research building was constructed in the early 1990s, and PEARL itself was inaugurated in 2006. The laboratories provide housing, facilities for atmospheric (and other) research, instruments, and workshops for maintenance and repair the instruments. Currently there are about 25 instruments operating at the site. Telephone and internet (via geostationary satellite) are available, but with limited bandwidth due to cost. The facility can accommodate 20-40 people at any time of the year.","The major emphasis at PEARL is on atmospheric research. The original purpose of the installation was to monitor stratospheric ozone, and although that work is still ongoing, the research has now broadened in scope to encompass the entire atmosphere and beyond. Current measurements include ozone and associated chemicals in the stratosphere as well as the troposphere, aerosols and particulates, radiation and fluxes and upper atmo­sphere temperatures, winds, and waves. Other research groups including biologists, astronomers, and geologists regularly make use of the nearby Eureka Weather Station as a base. Measurements are regularly submitted to the NDACC, TCCON, and AeroNet databases.",There is no local community. The nearest permanent facilities are the military base at Alert on the north side of Ellesmere Island and the community of Grise Fjord in southern Ellesmere Island. Both of these are about 450 km from PEARL.,"Access to the station is by chartered aircraft only, but the site can be accessed at any time of the year. Charter flights can be organised from Iqaluit, Resolute Bay, and Yellowknife. There is an annual sea-lift for bringing in larger equipment and goods. Transport around the site is by 4×4 truck.

","Due to the severe continental climate, the environmental conditions in the region are comparable with the subarctic zone of Northern Europe. The research site is representative for the Western Siberian pristine carbon accumulating peatland ecosystem (plain mires). The mires cover c. 60 % of the land surface and can be regarded as important sources/sinks of greenhouse gases and aerosols. The main mire type of the site is raised bogs of the type Pine-dwarf shrubs-bogs (ryam) characterised by pine trees, Ledum palustre and dwarf shrubs, with areas of Sphagnum fuscum. Interspersed are mires of the type poor fens (partly drained in the summer) dominated by Carex lasiocarpa and other graminoids, and Sphagnum balticum. Also ridge-hollow complexes, consisting of bog ridges and poor fen hollows are present. The (avi-) fauna includes many species typical for the peatland and extensive river floodplains near the station and of the relatively dry mixed forests between the peatlands and the floodplains.","The Mukhrino Field Station was opened in 2009. It is a two-storey wooden building with study/laboratory rooms, beds for 14 persons, a simple dining room with kitchen, and a Russian sauna. The experimental field is equipped with 1 km long walking boards, which cross the main mire ecosystem types and facilitate researchers access to perform experiments and measurements in and above the mires, without disturbing the ecosystems. In the centre of the field site, an equipment shelter has been built. Distributed across the field site are clusters of thermologgers, water level recorders, and nine semi-automatic chambers (1 m2) and an Eddy Covarians measuring station for measuring greenhouse gas fluxes.","The Mukhrino Field Station was primarily established for studies of the biodiversity (fauna, vegetation, mycology) and hydrology of the mire ecosystems, of the carbon storage in the peat layers, and for measurements of greenhouse gas fluxes to and from the pristine peatland complex, located next to the field station. The station is also used for analyses of Climate Change effects in peatland ecosystems and carbon balance, and the spatial comparison of key areas in S-N transects (57-67° N) as an analogue for Climate Change over time. The station houses specialists in vegetation science, remote sensing, mycology, hydrology, and greenhouse gas emission measurements. The Mukhrino Field Station welcomes foreign and national guests for collaboration, research, and educational purposes.","Near the Mukhrino Field Station, a limited number of local people, mostly from Khanty-Mansiysk town, can be met while fishing in the rivers and lakes.

NWR is centrally located and its population is made up of Inuit, Euro-Canadian, Innu and Metis people. LIRS is located in the Taiga/Boreal Forest Region. ","North West River experiences generally mild summers with cold winters. Winters usually begin in mid-November and last until mid-April and summers begin in June and end in early September. The temperature generally ranges from about -30 °C at its coldest in the winters to about 30 °C in the summers. The town is on a hill dividing Little Lake from the larger Lake Melville. A small band of water (North West River) connects the two. The area of North West River is located on a sandy plain surrounded by mountains. NWR falls within the Lake Melville Ecoregion, which is a unique ecosystem within Labrador. Immediately adjacent to the community are important waterfowl staging areas, seabird breeding colonies, and important breeding habitats for a variety of marine mammals. The nearby Mealy and Red Wine Mountains have endangered herds of woodland caribou. The eastern end of Lake Melville has been designated as an internationally Important Bird Area due to the high concentrations of moulting scoters in late summer. Numerous archaeological discoveries have been made in the area, the oldest of which is the Maritime Archaic Indian site dating 5000 bp. ","The facility is new but is seeing an increasing amount of use. The station is co-located with the College of the North Atlantic and the NWR Community Library, and includes employee and general office space, large board room, scientific laboratory, GIS/social science laboratory, general (wet) laboratory, archaeology lab, accommodation for four people, full kitchen and dining area, and storage and laundry space. Our primary scientific lab is currently being developed. Equipment includes: digital balances, a variety of microscopes, incubators, sample freezer, water purification, pH testing kit, centrifuge, digestion block, water bath, large volume stirrer, portable ventilation system, etc. There are more than seven work stations, sinks, teaching area, and lots of open space for further development. Also included: satellite internet and telephone service. ","LIRS is just coming online, but the Labrador Institute (LI) has a long history of research in Labrador in many disciplines, including but not limited to health research, arts and culture, social programs, climate change, archaeology, education, mining and resource development history, migratory birds, and land mammals. Currently, the LIRS is supporting and/or taking part in climate change research, land use studies, interior archaeology, archaeological mitigation, addictions awareness, aquatic ecology, soil amendment research, and mine tailings remediation. LIRS and LI are currently undergoing a period of significant growth. As a result, we will increase our capacity in environmental studies, climate change, earth sciences, anthropology, archaeology, and geography. We will also be starting an artist in residence programme. ","The research station is located in North West River, Central Labrador. Central Labrador has been inhabited by the Innu and Inuit for over 6000 years. The NunatuKavut community council land claim is also nearby, though this claim has not been settled, and the proposed Mealy Mountain National Park is also just across Lake Melville from LIRS. ","NWR is accessible by road all year round. Goose Bay Airport is a 30 minute drive from the station.

The station is situated on Haynes Ridge, overlooking the Haughton impact crater, a 23 km diameter crater formed approximately 39 million years ago (late Eocene). The location is approximately 1609 km from the Geographic North Pole and approximately 1287 km from the Magnetic North Pole.","Because of its relatively high elevation and its extreme northern latitude, Devon Island supports only a meagre population of small birds and mammals, including muskoxen. Animal life is concentrated in the Truelove Lowland area of the island, which has a favorable microclimate and supports relatively lush arctic vegetation. Temperatures during the brief growing season seldom exceed 10 °C and in winter can plunge to as low as -50 °C. With a polar desert ecology, Devon Island receives very little precipitation. Cape Liddon is an Important Bird Area (IBA) notable for its black guillemot and northern fulmar populations. Cape Vera, another IBA site, is also noted for its northern fulmar population. Devon Island is also notable for the presence of the Haughton impact crater, created some 39 million years ago when a meteorite about 2 km in diameter crashed into what were then forests. The impact left a crater approximately 23 km in diameter, which was a lake for several million years.","The Flashline Station was built by The Mars Society in 2001, and since then it has been used to conduct planetology studies: geological, biological, and climatology studies under conditions similar to those found on Mars, and to develop field tactics based on those explorations, to test habitat design features, tools, and technologies, and to assess crew selection protocols essential to future human spaceflight. ",Experiments at Flashline primarily focus on biodiversity surveys of the arctic desert and geological/geophysical study of the Haughton Crater area. Other experiments included a geophysical analysis of Haughton Crater which answered key questions on the physical characteristics of the 20-million year old meteor crater and examined microfossils in crater soil deposits. Logistics and engineering experiments are also conducted.,"The Mars Society invites researchers to live and work at the station, typically for one month during the arctic summer. Expeditions typically consist of a crew of between six and seven individuals. Typically 1 to 2 months prior to departing for the Canadian Arctic, the crew gathers for an initial face-to-face meeting and training session in Colorado, USA. The stations primary mission is to help develop key knowledge needed to prepare for human Mars exploration, and to inspire the public by making real the vision of human exploration of Mars. The station is 165 km northeast of Resolute/ Qausuittuq, Nunavut, where 80% of the population is Inuit.","Due to the harsh and dangerous environment of the Arctic, crew members must file an application for consideration and complete orientation and training prior to visiting the station. Crew members must travel by commercial airline to Resolute Bay, Canada. There they spend a few days organizing supplies and equipment and conducting some final training while waiting for clear weather. They then board a Twin Otter aircraft for the final leg of the journey to Devon Island.

AWIPEV operates and runs a second research base Jean Corbel situated at 5 km southeast of Ny-Ålesund. ,"Spitsbergen belongs to one of the northernmost archipelagos in the Arctic. Ny-Ålesund on the west coast is an international center for various modern Arctic research activities. The village is one of the world's northernmost human settlements and is surrounded by glaciers, moraines, rivers, mountains and a typical tundra system. Most of the fauna living in Svalbard is represented in the area with birds (auks, kittiwakes, terns, barnacle geese, etc.), reindeers, foxes, polar bears and often visible in the fjord are seals and sometimes belugas and walrus.","Ny-Ålesund was a mining town for commercial exploitation of the coal deposits in the Kongsforden area from 1916 to the closure of the mines in 1963. After the mining activity Ny-Ålesund developed into a research village providing laboratories, facilities and research infrastructures to scientists from many nations interested in polar research. The French research base Jean Corbel was established in 1963 c. 5 km from Ny-Ålesund village and has a capacity of eight persons in the summer. In 2003, AWI and IPEV decided to jointly operate their three stations (Koldewey, Rabot and Corbel) as the AWIPEV Arctic Research Base. The station provides logistical resources: boats, snowmobiles, vehicles, storage facilities (cold and warm, cooling facilities), field equipment, workshop and office facilities and scientific resources: laboratories, scientific equipment and sampling tools.","Research covers a large field of scientific disciplines. Both, long term and short term projects of atmospheric studies, marine and terrestrial biology, as well as cryosphere studies, are carried out at the AWIPEV Arctic Research Base. Many different measurements as well as field expeditions are possible at the base. Prominent examples are atmospheric long term measurements, scientific diving, glacier expeditions, seabirds as indicators of global changes in the marine ecosystems, installation of measuring systems in the permafrost and in the fjord, and launches of research balloons.

The mining activity in Ny-Ålesund lasted until 1963 and during the 1990s the village transformed into a multidisciplinary science settlement. The Arctic Station Dirigibile italia  was established in 1997, and since that time the Italian scientific community has contributed to high quality research as well as supporting and improving the development of scientific infrastructures. One of these is the Ny-Ålesund Marine Laboratory, an experimental laboratory for research in marine ecology and biochemistry. Recently a Metrology Laboratory for instrument calibration managed by the Italian station has been also established. "," Research programmes currently developed at the station deals with microbial ecology and evolution, soil science, biogeochemistry and energy fluxes; vegetation and permafrost studies; oceanography, marine biomarkers; atmosphere, aerosols, gases and clouds; remote sensing of the environment; sun-earth relations and space weather; human biology and medicine. Basically the activities are focused on long term monitoring of the essential climate variables but a great support is also provided for short period/seasonal campaigns. The CNR has set up several infrastructures such as the Climate Change Tower and the Gruvebadet Aerosol Laboratory to continuous monitor the atmosphere. Moreover, a selected area is equipped to monitor the changing in snow, vegetated surface, soil and active layer of the permafrost.

The southern side of Kongsfjord, on which Ny-Ålesund is situated, has 50 km2 of tundra and alluvial plain. Glaciers and sea confine a plant protection area at the head of the fjord. Numerous glaciers of various types occur in the area. Most bird species found in Svalbard are represented in the area with barnacle geese, eiders, auks, terns, and kittiwakes nesting in large numbers. Land mammals include reindeer, fox, and the occasional polar bear. The local fjord is home to ringed, bearded and common seals, walrus, and beluga. ","The UK has maintained a research station at Ny-Ålesund continuously since 1972. The NERC Arctic Research Station opened in1991. The station comprises 440 m2 of laboratory, workshop, and storage space plus single bedrooms. Additional accommodation can be provided by Kings Bay Company. The station provides laboratory, field equipment, telephone, computer facilities (fast web link), VHF radios, satellite telephones, firearms, and boats. Rental of snowmobiles for specific projects can be arranged.","The location is particularly suitable for ecological research, glacial/ periglacial geomorphology, hydrology, and atmo­spheric chemistry.","In 1991, Ny-Ålesund and the surrounding environment were designated as an area solely for scientific research.

In this town, more than 10 nations have their own station while using shared facilities for meals and recreation. The whole local community is focussed on science and maintenance of infrastructure. Several stations have independent terrestrial research programmes and the Netherlands Arctic Station is the smallest of all. ","Kongsfjorden is a beautiful high arctic environment with several glaciers terminating in the fjord. The raised beach terraces are sparsely vegetated with dense moss cover around small tundra lakes and below bird cliffs. Locally there are clear traces of former human activity by trappers and from coal mining. At present, the whole area is well-protected and a special permission is needed to enter the islands during the bird breeding season. In 1978, reindeer was re-introduced and since 1982 barnacle geese have established a colony and are regularly feeding between the houses. Both herbivores have a clear impact on the vegetation.","From 1916 to 1968, the village of Ny-Ålesund was a coal mining settlement. This village has now developed into a unique mix of stations, laboratories, and research infrastructure. There is a small international community of 25 to 180 people  all temporal residents. Tourists are discouraged to stay overnight. In 1990, the University of Groningen initiated a project on barnacle geese and later joined the shared facilities with the establishment of Nether­lands Arctic Station. The station consists of two small buildings for lodging with electricity but no plumbing. Shared facilities in town offer unique high-standard science and logistic support. There is a developing cooperation with the local German/French base AWIPEV.","Research focusses on the role of barnacle geese in the arctic ecosystem. Nutrient cycles, plant productivity, and vegetation patterns are studied to understand plant-herbivore interactions. Behaviour, timing, and breeding success of individually ringed geese are observed over their lifetime, and the effect of predators is studied as a dynamic interaction. Population trends of plants, herbivores, and predators are monitored in a warming environment. Long term experiments include grazing exclosures and greenhouses on paired vegetation plots. There are also projects focussing on the history of human exploitation and the effect of tourism on cultural heritage. ","The local community in Ny-Ålesund is a mixture of nationalities from the various stations. The area is owned by a company called Kings Bay, taking care of the logistics for the entire village. Ny-Ålesund has no permanent residents and all activity is linked to science. The closest town is the Norwegian village of Longyearbyen, which is the main hub of Svalbard. In Longyearbyen, permanent residents are few (c. 2100). There are no indigenous people and most inhabitants originate from the Norwegian mainland and live on Svalbard only because of their temporal job assignment. Tourism, local administration, science, and coal mining are the most important sources of income.","Throughout the year, Kings Bay organises two flights per week with a small plane (14 passengers) between Longyearbyen and Ny-Ålesund. In summer, there are about 30000 tourists landing by boat for just a few hours. There is only a limited amount of roads near the village. Local transportation is possible by car, bicycle, snowmobile, or foot. Small boats are used for transportation inside the fjord.

The hilly bedrock consists principally of gneissic rocks from the Precambrian belonging to the Canadian Shield. The village is located in a valley that opens to the shore of Sugluk inlet (a fjord). The surrounding landscape consists of rocky plateaus with a hilly topography. The region was deglaciated about 8000 years ago and sectors below the elevation of 150 m were inundated by the post-glacial dIberville Sea. Till and some glacio-fluvial sediments are the major surficial materials on the plateaus, while the Salluit valley and the other valleys that connect with the fjord (particularly at the fjord head) are floored with fluvial sediments in terraces and marine clay. The geology and the oceanography of the fjord are poorly studied. The fjord opens to Hudson Strait. Mean annual air temperature is c. -8 °C and annual precipitation c. 300 mm (50 % snow).","Research has been conducted in the region in both natural and human sciences since the early 1960s by various groups. Permafrost research by the CEN began in 1987. In the context of Climate Change, a major research program was undertaken in 2002 to support community adaptation to changing permafrost and to assist the community in addressing housing and infrastructure needs for the rapidly growing population. The field station (a house) was built in 2010 thanks to a grant acquired from a federal research infrastructure program.","Numerous theses and research papers have been published on permafrost, periglacial geomorphology (ice-wedges, slope processes), archaeology, climatology, paleo-climate (paleo-soils and lake cores), population, culture, and land management in the area. Climate and permafrost temperature data from automatic stations, in operation since August 2002, are available upon request at cen@cen.ulaval.ca. Data available through Nordicana D: www.cen.ulaval.ca/nordicanad/.","Inuit and their ancestors have occupied the region for over 3500 years.

The station consists of two 10 m2 bedroom barracks and one kitchen/living room/laboratory facility (18 m2). In between them, during the summer, a tent hall (40 m2) is raised. Electricity is from fossil fuel generator (230 V) and solar panels (12 V). Supplies to the station (equipment, food and fuel) are brought from Poland at the beginning of summer or bought in Longyearbyen.","Scientific investigations at the station are cover monitoring of both biotic and abiotic compartments of the natural environment. Meteorological surveys are based on stationary observations at the station, as well as automatic weather stations around the bay. Sites of permafrost studies, comprising ground temperature measurements are established and during the summer glaciological, hydrological, geomorphological, geological, geochemical, botanical observations are performed. Data are acquired according to standards of the Polish Governmental Integrated Monitoring system.","In the vicinity of the station, remnants of the Russian coal mine, Pyramiden - abandoned in 1998, are visible. Nowadays Pyramiden (about 20 people) is operated mostly for tourists. In Pyramiden there is a helipad, hotel and bar. Currency  NOK, cash only.
The capital of Svalbard, Longyearbyen (>2000 inhabitants), is located 60 km from the station. Longyearbyen has all facilities including airport, harbour, hospital, markets, hotels, gas station etc. Currency in operation is NOK, ATM is also available. ","Svalbard is accessible for scientific research based on the Svalbard Treaty (since 1920). Svalbard Environmental Protection Act established a number of national parks, although, the nearest area of the station is open for visitors without special permits. Research projects need to be registered. More info www.sysselmannen.no.
The most convenient way to access Longyearbyen is by regular flights from Norway. From Longyearbyen you can get to the station in summer by daily tourist ships (one way trip 4-5 hours) to Pyramiden in the morning and in the afternoon. Finally to get to the station from the pier in Pyramiden (4 km from the station). It takes up to one hour walking or faster by zodiac, if arranged prior to arrival. When transporting larger volumes of cargo, shipping from Poland is possible with arrival around the end of June. Zodiac boats are used for transportation within the fiord.

The field station is situated at an altitude of about 950 m a.s.l. on a saddle between Koryaksky and Avachinsky volcanoes (53°15 N, 158°44 E). The station is located in the Nalychevo Nature Park. The main landscape feature near the station is the valley of the Sukhaya Elizovskaya River, which drains the slopes of the volcanoes in the region. ","The surroundings of the field station are characterised by a large variety in landscape, flora, and fauna. The station itself is located in a shrub tundra zone, and the surroundings include altitudinal zonation from forest to glaciers. Both volcanoes near the station are occasionally active  Avachinskys last eruption occurred in 2001, and now the crater is covered by a lava neck with a heavy fumarole activity underneath. Koryaksky volcano is dormant, but in 1956 and 2008 it erupted with ash plumes and a pyroclastic flow. The area features pyroclastic slopes, where outcrops carved by rivers expose stratified lapilli tuffs, deep gullies, and a few small fumaroles. The fauna and vegetation within the surroundings of the station is typical for the Kamchatka peninsula, and one of the main species around the station is the arctic ground squirrel. Occasionally, bears, sable, and lynx visit the area. Different kinds of salmonid fish spawn in the rivers of the Nalychevo valley. ","Nalychevo Nature Park is part of the biggest protected area of the Kamchatka peninsula  the nature park Volcanoes of Kamchatka. The nature park was established in 1995 and became part of the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1996. The station can accommodate 24 people, and has kitchen and living room. Tenting is allowed both at the station and within the study area.","The research at Avachinsky Volcano Field Station focuses on the botany, the ecology, and the zoology of the volcanic tundra zone. Recently, investigations of hydrology, hydrogeology, glaciology, meteorology, geomorphology, and soil science were initiated. Since no long-term hydrological data are available for the rivers draining the volcanoes, the main purpose of the recently initiated studies is field-based assessments of water and sediment discharges within the study river. The station maintains databases containing records on plants, biota, and vegetation-cover ecology. Databases on hydrology and climate are being developed.","Avachinsky Volcano Research Station is the gate to the Nalychevo river valley, which is a protected area with different points of interest for all kinds of tourism. The status of the area as a national park protect it from industrial development and uncontrolled visits, but the abundance of fish in the rivers and proximity to the regions capital also attract poachers.","The research station can be reached by four-wheel drive vehicles from the nearby cities Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy and Elizovo (60 and 30 km away, respectively).

The nearest settlement is the Sami village Nikkaluokta, 25 km southeast of the station. There is a mountain tourist station 7 km, and a tourist hut 1 km from Tarfala.","Tarfala Research Station is situated in a rapidly changing environment, which offers good opportunities for a variety of bio-geochemical studies. The Storglaciären is one of the best studied glaciers in the World. The long mass-balance record shows how the glacier responds to seasonal climate variability. The retreat of other local glaciers since the early 1900s is also well documented. Permafrost in the catchment is patchy in the lower parts of the valleys but is continuous at higher altitudes. The vegetation ranges from high-alpine flora to mountain birch forest at the tree-line. Wildlife in the area includes reindeer, moose, brown bear, wolverine, fox, hare, stoat, lemmings, and ptarmigan.","The measurements of mass balance on Storglaciären started in the spring of 1946. At that time the scientists used a simple tourist hut as base-camp. In the 1950s, a couple of buildings were built on the present location of the station. The facility could welcome the first students and international scientists in the early 1960s. Today, Tarfala Research Station is a modern facility offering research and education opportunities in a unique subarctic high-alpine setting. Tarfala has c. 25 beds for guests. Rooms with two to four beds are located in houses with running water and dry toilets. Included in the per diem price is breakfast, packed lunch, and dinner. There are no shops in the vicinity.

It is on Cree land and is run in collaboration with the Cree First Nation of Whapmagoostui. ","The CEN Whapmagoostui-Kuujjuarapik Research Station (55°16 N, 77°45 W) is located on the eastern shore of Hudson Bay at the maritime limit of James Bay, and in the adjacent villages of Whapmagoostui (Cree First Nation) and Kuujjuarapik (Inuit). ","The climate at Whapmagoostui-Kuujjuarapik is strongly influenced by the proximity of Hudson Bay, and the recent pronounced loss of sea ice in this sector of northern Canada has been accompanied by large increases in air temperature. Discontinuous or scattered permafrost occurs throughout the region and is degrading rapidly. Whapmagoostui-Kuujjuarapik is located at the terrestrial boundary between taiga and tundra. South of the Great Whale River is the taiga zone (Boreal forest), while north of the river, the forest tundra zone progressively dominates the landscape. The vegetation type is coastal forest tundra, with some 400 recorded species. Parabolic dunes occur along the coast and are strongly influenced by plant cover. Paleoecological studies have documented the Holocene evolution of landscapes, including lakes, wetlands, and forests. The Manitounuk Islands, located just a little north along the coast, are part of the Hudsonian cuestas that are characterized by rocky beaches and vertiginous cliffs.","The first signs of human occupation in the Whapmagoostui-Kuujjuarapik region have been dated at 3800 BP. In the past, the English name Great Whale and the French name Poste-de-la-­Baleine have been used to designate this community. The ­Hudson Bay Company (HBC) established the first fur trade post here in 1750 and marked the onset of continuous occupation. This station is the CENs principal field station and has operated since the 1970s, with diverse research projects on past and present environments. In 2010, major upgrades to the station were undertaken, consisting of the construction of a state-of-art Community Science Centre to serve the needs of the circumpolar science community for research planning, information exchange, national research workshops, and coordination of field operations, and the local communities for information exchange, identification of northern research needs, science training of northerners, exchange of traditional knowledge, and outreach activities. The centre offers a conference room with a capacity for 50 participants, a permanent, interactive display on local natural history and on CEN research activities. In addition to this new building, the station also has wet and dry laboratories, a greenhouse, a dormitory, a cafeteria (with full-meal services during the summer season), vehicles for rent, wireless internet, rental of sampling and camping equipment, and an onsite station manager. ","Current projects include work on biodiversity and dynamics of northern aquatic ecosystems; impacts of thawing permafrost in the context of global warming; wetland paleoecology; restoration of vegetation in degraded sites, and research on mercury dynamics (in relation to air, precipitation, snow). An overview of past studies in this region is given in: Bhiry, N., et al., 2011: Ecoscience 18: 182-203. CEN operates several climate stations in the area. In addition to the available scientific literature, CEN has extensive climate data recorded since 1957 which are available through Nordicana D: www.cen.ulaval.ca/nordicanad/. ","This bicultural community represents the ancestral limit of the Cree and Inuit territories. It is both the northernmost Cree community and the southernmost Inuit community in Quebec. Whapmagoostui-Kuujjuarapik has a population of about 1600 inhabitants. The spoken languages are Cree, Inuktitut, and English with some French. Rapid social, economic, and environmental change, initiated in the mid-20th century, continues to this day. ","Whapmagoostui-Kuujjuarapik is only accessible by commercial airlines.

The station is part of the CEN Network of research stations. The station is run in close collaboration with the community of Kangiqsualujjuaq and the Qiniqtiq Land Holding Corporation.,"The station is situated in the community of Kangiqsualujjuaq (population of 942 in 2016), on the shores of George River which flows into Ungava Bay, Nunavik, Quebec, Canada. This region is characterized by deep valleys shaped by glacier retreat and steep cliffs. Several remains from the last glaciation can be found here: trough valleys, cirques, morainic ridges, suspended valleys, etc. The village is the gateway to Kuururjuaq Park and the Torngat Mountains (Nunavik Provincial Parks). Ulittaniujalik Park, a second provincial park operated by Nunavik Parks, is currently being created. In the area is Mount Caubvick (D'Iberville), the highest peak in the province of Quebec culminating at 1646m. ","The cold climate and topographic heterogeneity create a diverse landscape with tundra, forest tundra and boreal forest vegetation. The valley bottoms are ecologically rich, characterized by a rise of the boreal forest (with the presence of spruce, larch, birch, etc.) that contrasts with the bare areas of the region's slopes and peaks. In terms of wildlife, the distribution of species is closely linked to vegetation, relief and climate. A special feature of this area is the presence of the George River caribou herd and further from the village, the Torngat Mountains herd. Wolf, black bear, snowy owl and willow ptarmigan also inhabit this area. Atlantic salmon and Arctic char are numerous in the region's rivers. As for Ungava Bay and the rivers that flow into it, it represents an estuary rich in salmon, Arctic char, brook trout, beluga whales, and several seal species. The area is characterized with discontinuous permafrost. ","The station officially opened in the summer of 2018. It is open year-round and has 2 rooms, one with 1 bunk bed (2 beds) and one with two bunk beds (4 beds). The station also has one meeting room for about 25 persons, a kitchen, a sample manipulation room, and 2 bathrooms (one with shower and washer/dryer for residents). Power source is electrical, solar panels will be installed shortly. There is running water that is drinkable. Heating is with an oil furnace. Garbage is collected on a weekly basis, there are bins outside of the stations for this purpose. There is no recycling facility in the village. Chemical storage is not authorized. There is no fumehood, hence only mild chemicals can be used. All chemicals brought in must be brought out immediately. For sample preparation, there is an oven, a freezer (-80°C), refrigerator, scales, some basic glassware, and centrifuge","Past and current research focuses on permafrost, coastal geology and geomorphological characterization of the region. Other research areas cover caribou population dynamics, impacts of permafrost thawing in the context of climate warming; slope dynamics; wetland paleoecology; snow and ice dynamics; water quality and contamination; and plant community dynamics and northern plant response to climate change. Archaeological studies and community follow-up activities also take place such as the Avativut project ""Science in Nunavik, high school students learning in relation to their territory"". 

CEN has been collecting extensive climate data since 1987 and currently operates four SILA climate stations. Seven thermistor cables were also installed to monitor permafrost temperature at various depths.

","The station is located directly within the limits of the village of Kangiqsualujjuaq which has a population of 942 inhabitants. Inuktitut, English and some French are spoken. As for the history, archaeological sites associated with Thule, Dorset and pre-Dorset populations have been identified in the Kangiqsualujjuaq area. The first traces of occupation are dated around 2350 BP. In 1838, the first trading post was established at the present site of the village by the Hudson's Bay Company. In 1959, the first Inuit co-op, the Fédération des coopératives du Nouveau-Québec (FCNQ) was founded in Kangiqsualujjuaq. Until 1980, the village was known as George River or Port Nouveau-Québec. ","Daily access by commercial airline (Air Inuit) from Kuujjuaq. Kuujjuaq is accessible by commercial airline (Air Inuit, First Air) through Montreal, Ottawa and Quebec. The airport is only a few kilometres from the station. Every summer, two cargo ships allow shipping of heavy equipment and materials (May-June to August-September), though this requires advance planning. One ATV (1 passenger) and one side-by-side (6 passengers) can be rented at the station. Snowmobiles, trucks, canoes, and other ATVs can be rented in the village.

No official research permit is required but local authorities must accept all research activities before they take place.

The adjacent Barrow Environmental Observatory comprises 30.21 km2 of tundra, lakes, and wetlands reserved for scientific research including long-term environmental monitoring and habitat manipulation experiments.","Barrow is characterised by a polar maritime climate but is semi-arid (c. 150 mm annual precipitation). It lies north of the tree-line so the dominant vegetation types are grass, moss, and sedge. Virtually all land in the area is underlain by permafrost within a few meters of the surface. The landscape is characterised by thermokarst lakes and drained lake basins undergoing plant succession. Polar bears and Arctic foxes are found in the region. A large number of transient bird species migrate to the North Slope during the summer including snowy owl, tundra swan, snow bunting, and various species of geese and ducks, including the endangered Stellers and spectacled eiders. Caribou are frequently observed in the area. During the spring, bowhead whales migrate close to shore, and both gray and beluga whales are often sighted during the summer.","Barrow has a long research history starting with the establishment of an observation station during the First International Polar Year (1882-1883)  hosting near-continuous measurements since then. The Arctic Research Laboratory was established in 1947 and has supported a vast number of atmospheric, biological, oceanic, and terrestrial research activities. Present facilities include modern laboratories, storage, internet access, local accommodations, and cafeteria or self catering facilities. Vehicle support can also be arranged. Restaurants, supplies, and a grocery store are available in town. Several other programs funded through the US government maintain additional facilities in Barrow including the National Weather Service and Earth System Research Laboratory (both part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin.), Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Climate Research Facility (Dept. of Energy), and the US Fish and Wildlife Service (Dept. of Interior). Additionally, the North Slope Borough Department of Wildlife Management is based in Barrow.","Approximately 50 individual research projects are supported annually. Much of the work at Barrow involves atmospheric chemistry, ecosystem dynamics, plant/animal phenology studies, and Climate Change monitoring. Many sea ice studies are also based in the area. Limnological and large animal physiology projects are occasionally undertaken. ","Barrow has been occupied by humans for at least 1200 years, and a strong Iñupiaq culture is still practiced today including subsistence hunting and whaling activities. English is the predominant language but many residents speak Iñupiaq. The village is the political, logistical, and administrative hub of the 245000 km2 North Slope Borough, and as a result most modern conveniences are available. Summer tourism is an important part of the economy, and nearby resource extraction is becoming more prevalent. Several mobile phone carriers provide reliable service. Off-road access to the tundra (i.e. for hiking) requires a local land use permit. There are several gymnasiums open to the public and Barrow High School provides opportunities for spectator sports. Ilisavik College provides continuing education and vocational training to students throughout the region.","There is no road access to Barrow, but the town is serviced by commercial airlines (Alaska Airlines, Era Alaska) with multiple daily flights, year-round. Both fixed-wing aircrafts and helicopters can be chartered for research activities from vendors based in Fairbanks (800 km away) or Anchorage (1200 km away) and staged from the Barrow Airport. Additionally, Northern Air Cargo provides commercial shipping services and the US Postal Service delivers mail and small packages daily.

It lies about 60 km north of the continuous pine forest line and belongs to the subarctic Mountain Birch Forest Zone close to both the local pine tree line and the birch tree line at the forest-tundra ecotone. ","The station is close to a wide range of ecosystems from pine stands at low altitudes to mountain birch forests and low alpine tundra as well as mires (also palsas), lakes, and rivers. Several large-scale outbreaks of birch feeding moth larvae are characteristic for the birch forests. The latest outbreak in 2005-2009 destroyed about 400 km2 of the treeline birch forests in Utsjoki. Grazing by semi-domesticated reindeer is another important factor that shapes the ecosystems. The area is part of the basin of the river Teno/Tana which is one of the top salmon rivers in Europe.","The station was founded in 1958. The station, including a weather station of Finnish Meteorological Institute, consists of several buildings. It has the capacity to accommodate about 40 guests in winter and up to 70 in summertime. It is open year-round, but full-board meals will be offered only during the main field season (from May to September), except for larger groups. The station provides laboratories, a workshop, a lecture hall, and accommodation buildings. During recent years the station has had about 100 Finnish and 70 foreign visiting scientists each year.","Kevo Subarctic Research Station has got a long tradition in manipulative experiments addressing cause-effect relationships of anthropogenic environmental changes. In ecological science it is known for the research on plant herbivore interactions and in geographical science for research on palsa mires. There are long-term field experiments studying the effects of aerial pollutants and the impacts of reindeer grazing. The station has got arboretums with different origins of arctic treeline species.

Also a small lake is found within the area. In total, 101 vascular plant species and 19 moss species have been recorded at the site. Birds dominate the vertebrate fauna with 22 species recorded in the area. Most notable of these are whooper swans (Cygnus cygnus), great northern divers (Gavia immer), and redwings (Turdus iliacus) in summer; snow bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis) in winter and raven (Corvus corax) and ptarmigan (Lagopus muta) year around. Three species of mammals occur at the site: Arctic fox (Alopex lagopus), American mink (Mustela vison), and wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus). Two species of fish occur in the lake: three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and brown trout (Salmo trutta). ","The Litla-Skard site was designated as a bio-monitoring area in 1996. Litla-Skard is an old, lowland farm. The site is now owned by the Iceland Forest Service. In the past most of the area was used for grazing livestock, mainly sheep. The site has not been grazed since 1985. Afforestation at the site is very limited and disturbance level from human activities is low. The total land area of the Litla-Skard bio-monitoring area is 3 km2 with an elevation of 60-230 m a.s.l.

The nearest town is Gorno-Altaisk, about 250 km northwest of the station.","The Aktru Research Station is surrounded by a wide range of ecosystems changing with altitude: Kuray basin intermountain steppe, steppe belt on the mountain slopes, forest belt, high-mountain belt with alpine landscapes and glaciers, high-mountain tundra (goltsy), as well as cryophyte steppe landscapes. A typical high-mountain vegetation is the Pseudo-tundra, formed in the periphery of glacial fields under Pleistocene continental climate conditions. Some rare animal species reside in Aktru valley, e.g. snow leopards, wolverines, lynx, musk deer, mountain goats, cranes, and lama ducks. ","The Aktru Research Station was founded in 1956 by V.M. Tronov and has been in operation until today. From 1975 to 1995, a meteorological station was operated by the State Hydrometeorological Service. Since 2008 new buildings were constructed comprising a staff house, a dining room for 150 persons, a summer cafeteria for 30 persons, a diesel station, as well as showers and toilets. The older buildings, recently renovated includes a hospital, classrooms, three apartments (housing c. 60 people), a warehouse, a Banya (Russian sauna), and a tent camp for 200 persons.","The research at Aktru Research Station focuses on glaciology, hydrology, meteorology, geomorphology, ecology, botany, zoo­logy, and soil science. The main aims are to study climate-driven glaciers dynamics, hydrological regimes, cryogenic processes, landscape patterns, and biota. Different international projects investigate mountain mires in terms of climate-driven changes of landscape patterns, biogeo­chemistry, and productivity. Kuray Basin, an inter-mountain depression, situated at the foot of the North-Chuya Range (10 km from Aktru Station) is a key site for studying the Altai megafloods. Existing databases contain records on climate, hydrology, and glacier dynamics, as well as on plants and vegetation-cover ­ecology.","The traditional Altais and Kazakhs culture still plays a major role in the daily life of the region (nomadic animal husbandry, fishing, and hunting).

","The village is located 15 km north of Richmond Gulf (Lac Guillaume-Delisle), an immense inland bay connected to the Hudson Bay via a rocky gulch resembling a canyon. The many rivers flowing into the Gulf make its waters brackish and rich in brook trout, whitefish, seal, and beluga. The sheltered maritime environment features sporadic black spruce and larch, but the surrounding area is rather characterised by shrub tundra, discontinuous permafrost (mostly palsa bogs), and thermokarst lakes. In front of the village are the Nastapoka Islands (cuestas) where many species of birds, such as common loons, eider ducks, and peregrine falcons, find summer shelter and nest. The steep cliffs plunge into the Nastapoka Sound with waters up to 110 m deep. About 30 km north of Umiujaq is the Nastapoka River with its scenic 30 m high falls. The river estuary is extraordinarily rich and diverse with landlocked freshwater seals, salmon, and many fish species. Access to the Tursujuq Provincial Park, as well as to the marine/coastal-, river-, lake-, mountainous-, deltaic-, and shrub tundra environments, and the migrating treeline, is from Umiujaq.","Umiujaq was established in 1986 by Inuit from Kuujjuarapik, 160 km to the south, who decided to relocate in the region where they hoped to better preserve their traditional lifestyle in an area where fish and game were not threatened by development. CENs research has been conducted here since 1980. In previous years, CEN researchers used a meat plant/warehouse that has shared ownership (CEN, Anniturvik Landholding Corporation, and Makivik Corporation). In 2010, CEN undertook major station upgrades and restored the warehouse (still shared with its partners), built a vehicle garage, and a three-bedroom house. The facility is next to a pier for easy maritime access and can accommodate seven to eight people at a time. The house is equipped with partial solar powered electricity, running water (kitchen, toilet, and laundry), and oil heating. ","Past and present research has focused on permafrost studies, coastal geology, and geomorphological characterisation of the region. Other research topics cover biodiversity and dynamics of northern aquatic ecosystems, impacts of thawing permafrost in the context of global warming, wetlands paleoecology, research on mercury dynamics (air, precipitation, snow), snow and ice dynamics, greenhouse gas emissions from thermokarst ponds and tundra, sea and lake bottom mapping, and plant community dynamics and response of northern plants to Climate Change. Archeological studies and community based monitoring activities have also taken place. CEN operates four climate stations in the area and thermistor cables are installed to monitor permafrost temperature. CEN has extensive climate data since 1997 which are available through Nordicana D: www.cen.ulaval.ca/nordicanad/.","Umiujaq has a population of about 500 inhabitants, mainly Inuit.

The station is the property of the Radisson municipality. It is run and operated by the following three member institutions of the Centre détudes Nordiques (CEN: Centre for Northern Studies): Université Laval, Université du Québec à Rimouski and Centre Eau, Terre et Environnement of the Institut national de la recherche scientifique. The station has a long-term lease with the municipality. The CEN secretariat based at Université Laval oversees the management of the station. This station is part of the CEN Network, more precisely the Qaujisarvik Network of stations, and is the most southerly station of the network at 53°N. The vast expanse of the Québec territory, adjacent to James Bay, is administered by the Société dénergie de la Baie James which is a subsidiary of Hydro Québec. Hydro Québec is responsible for emergency services and requires an annual logistical and security plan for all visitors.","The station is in the centre of the village of Radisson (53°47 N, 77°37 W), a small village of approximately 350 inhabitants situated on the margins of the Robert-Bourassa hydroelectric dam (LG2), which is part of the La Grande River hydroelectric complex. ","Radisson is surrounded by the eastern Canadian Shield taiga with Boreal forest that is dominated by black spruce and grey pine. The region is relatively poor in terms of plant species diversity with a count of about 350 vascular plant species, yet the diversity in wildlife is rich with forty mammal and sixty bird species. Forest fires are a very dynamic element of the region, sculpting the landscape into natural mosaics nested between rocky hills which confine the lower wetlands (mainly lakes and bogs). Radisson is situated in a postglacial marine invasion with limited drainage due to the presence of clay in the lowlands. From 1989 to 1996, fires within the town of Radisson considerably changed the landscape. The region has been studied and monitored extensively since 1974 in the context of the development of the hydroelectric complex. Consequently, Hydro-Québec and the Société dénergie de la baie de James have produced several syntheses on the area.","Researchers from the CEN have been working in this region since 1994, but the station was established in 1999 and was upgraded in 2010. The facility consists of three houses (3 bedrooms each), with a total capacity for 25 people, a laboratory building with a chemical hut, a meeting room, and a workshop. ","Past research has focused on regional ecosystem dynamics, specifically on the response of the forest to disturbances such as fire and insect outbreaks, dendrochronology, riparian vegetation, snow, secular variations in water levels, hydrology, climate and reservoirs, greenhouse gas emission by reservoirs, and limnology. Research topics have covered issues on wildlife (birds, caribou, small mammals, and fish) and vegetation (biodiversity). CEN operates three climate stations in the area, one of which is near the town, another is in the centre of the LG2 reservoir, and a third is approximately 350 km inland on an island of the LaForge 1 reservoir. Besides scientific literature, CEN has also collected extensive climate datasets since 1996, which are available through Nordicana D: www.cen.ulaval.ca/nordicanad/. ","The town of Radisson is located on the south shore of the La Grande River which drains the water from the LaGrande hydroelectric complex. It is the most northern French speaking community of Québec. It is also the only non-aboriginal community north of 53°N. Despite its remoteness, Radisson offers a wide array of services: i.e. gas station, hardware and grocery store, and a small hotel. ","Radisson is accessible by road. From Matagami, the James Bay route covers over 624 km. This route provides access to several Cree villages and trans-taiga ecosystems which border the hydroelectric reservoirs. It is a private road requiring user registration at the entry gate for security reasons.

It belongs to the Thule Institute, and is a regional unit of the University of Oulu in Kuusamo, Finland. ","Oulanka Research Station is situated in the river valley of Oulanka within the Oulanka National Park (66°22 N, 29°19 E, 167 m a.s.l.). The station is located c. 25 km south of the Arctic Circle, 13 km west of the Russian border, about 280 km northeast of Oulu, and 55 km north of Kuusamo. ","Oulanka Research Station operates and offers access to visitors throughout the year. The station is a primary location for field courses at Oulu University (especially biology and geography) with 5-8 different courses and roughly 1500 person-days per year. The station lies in the heart of the Oulanka National Park at an optimal distance to various field research locations. Being a multi-disciplinary research station, Oulanka is open to almost all kinds of research activities. The station has 82 beds, two well-equipped laboratories, an auditorium, classrooms, workshops, and high-speed internet. ","Oulanka National Park is a northern biodiversity hot-spot, thanks to the calcium-rich bedrock, varying topography, and large environmental gradients within a small area. Moreover, it has historically been at the cross-roads for movement of northern, southern and eastern species. Unlike most of Finland, the local rivers drain towards the northeast, i.e. to the White Sea. ","The study area includes the towns of Kuusamo, Posio, Taivalkoski, and Salla and covers an area of roughly 100 × 200 km. Most of the research activity is concentrated in and around the Oulanka National Park. Historically research has been focused on animal and plant ecology as well as geography. Recently sociological aspects have been included as well. Oulanka has a broad range of long-term data series available for researchers. These include both biological and physical/chemical datasets, and many of them have been collected since 1966. The datasets cover time-series on meteorology, water chemistry of streams and lakes, phenology, ice cover, snow cover, active layer depth, air pollution, as well as different plant and animal species, etc. Oulanka also offers a recently acquired, extremely comprehensive (70 × 90 km) set of high-resolution aerial photographs covering three different areas, i.e. the early 1950s, the early 1980s, and c. 2005. ","The nearest village with stores and services is 13 km away, while the ski centre of Ruka is 30 km away.

Nibio Svanhovd is situated in Svanvik, a small village in the Pasvik Valley. It is located at the western shore of the Pasvik River that originates from the huge Lake Inari in Finland and flows northwards into the Barents Sea and defines the border between Norway and Russia.","The surroundings in the Pasvik Valley are part of the western distribution limit of the Russian taiga and the fauna and flora has a strong eastern influence, with many species not found in other areas of Europe, e.g. interesting aquatic flora. The area includes old-growth pine forest, wetlands, lakes, rivers, mountain birch forest, tundra, seashore, and fjords. Most groups of organisms in the area are poorly studied with many still unknown species in certain taxa. The area is also found to be the northernmost distribution of several species and the Pasvik River has a very high biological diversity compared to other rivers in Norway. The area is exposed to several invading species.","Svanhovd was established in 1934 as a governmental demonstration farm to provide expertise and aid to the settlers of the Pasvik Valley. In the early 1990s, a change of activity towards environmental research was motivated in particular due to large emissions from the metal smelters in the Russian city Nikel (9 km away from Svanhovd). 2001, a visitor centre for the Øvre Pasvik National Park was established and, in 2006, Svanhovd Environmental Centre became a part of the Norwegian Institute for Agricultural and Environmental Research. The laboratory at Bioforsk Svanhovd has facilities for microbiological, chemical-physical, and DNA-analysis. It is accredited for DNA analyses of brown bears. Bioforsk Svanhovd has a conference centre with accommodation for 50 persons (in single and double rooms, with private bathrooms). Guests are free to use Svanhovds fireplace, TV lounge, sauna, and laundry room. The conference centre offers an auditorium for 80 persons, and smaller meeting rooms for 5 to 30 persons. Additional accommodation can be arranged in Svanvik (walking distance) and at hotels in Kirkenes (45 minutes by car).","The region offers round-the-corner ecological laboratories for several important research areas: Pristine nature in subarctic ecosystems, changes in land use (farming and abandoned land), climatic and environmental gradients, etc. Bioforsk Svanhovd works with issues related to natural resources, protected areas, biological diversity, and environmental research in the Barents Region. Some work on agricultural issues is also carried out. Each year, surveys within the national brown-bear monitoring programme in Norway, Finland, Sweden, and Russia is carried out.","The Pasvik Valley offers nature tourism, fishing, bird-watching, hunting, forestry, northern agriculture, reindeer husbandry, mining, and research. Kirkenes (c. 3400 inhabitants), that is located 40 km NW of Svanhovd, was established in late nineteenth century as a port town for the mining industry at Bjørnevatn a few km away and for forestry. The area has been inhabited by Sami people for several centuries.","Svanhovd is an excellent meeting point for researchers and visitors from all over the world, situated in NE Norway in close vicinity to Russia, Finland, and Sweden, and with the facilities offered by Svanhovd Conference Centre. The Botanical Garden at Svanhovd demonstrates the diversity of plants and trees in the Pasvik Valley. It is easy to come to Svanhovd, with daily flights from Oslo Gardermoen Airport to Kirkenes Airport (Høybuktmoen), with about 2 hours flight time (SAS and Norwegian), and then 45 minutes (40 km) by car to Svanhovd (Road 885).

Small lakes, wetlands, and rivers are located around the station, which lies on the south facing slope of a small hill. Nearest population centres and industry are 100 km away. ","The station is located in a nature reserve, and thus the natural state of the environment in the region is protected. The alpine tree line (Pinus sylvestris, Betula pubescens subsp. czerepanovii, and Betula nana) lies at about 470 m a.s.l. Below it, old-growth pine forests with some open mires and spruce swamps are the main vegetation types. Open dry tundra heath lies above the tree line. The climate is sub-continental with an annual mean air temperature of -0.5°C and an annual precipitation of 600 mm. There are several rare northern and eastern species nesting in the nature reserve, e.g. dotterel (Charadrius morinellus) and red-flanked bluetail (Tarsiger cyanurus).","The station was established in 1967 when the first 50 m2 log cabin was built in the middle of the wilderness. Later on, the station has been extended, and currently it can accommodate c. 20 researchers indoors and more outdoors in tents. There are small but efficient working facilities for indoor research work including e.g. wireless network, workstations, and reference library. The station is connected to the main electricity network but has also a generator for exceptional cases. The station staff on duty every day, year around. The nearest commercial facilities, such as grocery store and healthcare centre, are located 100 km away in the village of Savukoski. ","The research focuses on interactions between the subarctic ecosystems and the atmosphere. The core is at the SMEAR I (Station for Measuring Ecosystem Atmosphere Relations) station at the Kotovaara hill (800 m from the station). Since early 1990s, continuous measurements on tree gas exchange (photosynthesis, transpiration), soil respiration, tree growth, weather, gas, and aerosol concentrations and fluxes, and pollutant transport have been performed. The measurements are online and maintained throughout the year. The data are stored in an open database. In addition, several long (over 40 years) observation series on e.g. snow conditions, nesting birds, and phenology, as well as shorter term campaigns, on e.g. forest fire regimes and tree regeneration, exist in the station data repositories. ","The nearest local village is Savukoski, c. 100 km to the southwest. The forests are used intensively for forestry and reindeer husbandry. The nearby Urho Kekkonen National Park and other protected areas as well as fish-rich rivers fascinate large numbers of tourists. Recently, plans have been proposed for opening a large open pit phosphorus mine and a concentration plant in the close vicinity of Värriö Strict Nature Reserve. ","The station is accessed by foot (during summer) or by ski (during winter), assistance with snowmobile or a quad bike is available for instruments and larger luggage.

Here, skálanes sits within a 1250 hectare (3089 acre) independent nature reserve containing habitats and ecosystems representative of the East fjords region, including the common species of flora and fauna and especially known as a habitat for a wide variety of bird species.","The nature reserve surrounding Skálanes includes pastures, shoreline, fresh water rivers, inter tidal, hills, mountains, wetlands and a 640 m. coastal cliff. The area is a habitat of a rich wildlife in­cluding reindeer, the arctic fox and 47 different bird species such as a large arctic tern colony, puffins and a eider colony. 

Plants of arctic origin are characteristic to the area and a large col­lection of archaeological sites is found within the nature reserve.  The research center includes human activities such as eider farm­ing, a vegetable garden and a small holding of ducks, pigs and chickens in the summer season. ","Skálanes was established in 2005 as an experimental nature and heritage research center by the two local natural scientists, Ólafur Örn Pétursson and Rannveig Þorhallsdottir. The intention of Skálanes to be a place of learning  a place where the Ice­landic environment and cultural history can be researched and interpreted. The remote and restored farmhouse at the mouth of Seyðisfjörður provides an ideal location for exploring the arctic wildlife and native plants, the mountains, waterfalls, sea cliffs, meadows and beaches. The site and center is available as a space for researchers and visitors to interact with nature, history and each other to develop ideas and be exposed to new ones. 

Skálanes can accommodate up to 20 people in separate and shared bedrooms, including two large living rooms with work desks, a dining hall, a professionally equipped kitchen, five bathrooms and an outdoor shower and sauna. Two laboratories (wet and a dry) are currently under construction and will be ready during Spring 2018. 

Skálanes is currently hosting 1-12 week student excursions mainly from American and British universities. The visiting students and researchers primarily work within the following fields: ecology, biology, geography, archaeology , computer science, zoology, and geology. ","We are currently developing a monitoring program and a new database at Skálanes. The databases are currently not all publisha­ble, but can act as a reference for further studies. Avian time series and baseline data on geology, plants, insects, birds is available. ","The nearest town, Seyðisfjörður, consists of 650 inhabitants. It is historically a fishing community based around primary indus­tries. During the past 20 year it has gone through a transforma­tion process with more emphasis on arts and culture to counter­mand the decline of its historic industry base. This has increased its attraction for tourists and also for individuals focusing on arts and creativity. The town has a big hospital, a primary school, an art school, a large community center, 2-5 restaurants depending on the season and a number of art residencies.","Egilsstaðir Domestic Airport is located 25km from Seyðisfjörður. Visitors at Skálanes will have to take the local bus or drive with the Skálanes staff to and from the airport driving over a moun­tain pass at 650m stretching along a 10km plateau. During the winter season the road to Seyðisfjörður can become momentar­ily impassable due to snow and storm intensity. All travel to and from town should be planned according to the weather forecast. 

From Seyðisfjörður you follow a 17km dirt road out of the fjord towards the open sea. The drive can only be done in a large 4×4 wheel drive as the road out to Skálanes contains three large river crossings. Travel from town to Skálanes takes approximately 25 minutes in clear, snow free conditions.

This station is part of the CEN Network, more precisely the Qaujisarvik Network of stations and is part of a provincial park that is co-managed by KRG and the government of Québec (Tursujuq National Park).","Situated in Nunavik on the shores of Clearwater Lake (Lac à l Eau Claire, 56°20 N, 74°27 W), the station is about 125 km inland from the eastern coast of Hudson Bay. ","Clearwater Lake is the second largest natural lake of the province of Québec (2243 km2). It sits at an altitude of 240 m, the limit reached by the postglacial sea, and drains into Hudson Bay via Clearwater River (Rivière à l Eau-Claire) with a maximum outflow rate of 150 m3/s. The lake features two adjacent, circular basins (26 and 36 km in diameter) that were created by a meteoritic impact about 290 ± 20 million years ago (Permian Age). Even though vascular plant diversity is low on regional granite gneisses, the volcanic breccias (clastic-textured extrusive igneous rocks) situated on the islands of the western basin (11 islands forming a circle) are populated by 250 vascular species, 15% of which are specific to the shores. Avifauna is abundant and the islands constitute an enclave for shrub tundra in an area that is rather characterised by forest tundra.","CEN research has been conducted here since 1980, but the station buildings are recent, built in 2000 and upgraded in 2011. The buildings were originally built by outfitters but have been considerably upgraded by the CEN. The three buildings can accommodate nine people. They are equipped with solar-powered electricity, running water, dry toilettes, and oil heating. The station is accessible from June to October by float plane or helicopter. About 10 km to the southeast, there is a natural airstrip maintained by Air Inuit. However, a river separates the station from the airstrip.","Past research has focused on regional ecosystem dynamics, specifically on the response of the forest to disturbances such as fire and insect outbreaks, dendrochronology, riparian vegetation and biodiversity, periglacial processes, secular variations in water levels, and hydrology. Other research topics have covered limnology of the two basins, geological and geomorphological history, and biophysical features of the area. Wildlife studies (birds, caribou, small mammals, fish, and biting insects) have also been conducted, as well as archeological studies (recently). CEN operates three climate stations in and around the western basin of the lake, one of which is on a small island directly in the centre of the basin. In addition to scientific literature, CEN has extensive climate data since 1986 which are available through Nordicana D: www.cen.ulaval.ca/nordicanad/.","Clearwater Lake is situated within the boundaries of a provincial park and on aboriginal land. First Nations people, the Cree, still use the land extensively for hunting and fishing, especially during spring and autumn.

","The station is located at 65°40 N and 38°10 W in southeast Greenland, about 20 km north of the small town Tasiilaq (Ammassalik). The station is situated on the shore of the Sermilik Fjord on the west side of Ammassalik Island adjacent to the Mittivakkat Glacier, a local small ice cap.","The research area is situated in the low arctic coastal vegetation zone, and demonstrates a large flora diversity. It is dominated by dwarf-shrub heaths, snow-bed communities, and open fell-field communities. Fens, herb slopes, and copses are present but are only found in smaller niches in the alpine dominated landscape.","During an expedition in 1933, led by the famous polar researcher Knud Rasmussen, the first surveys of glaciers and geomorphology were carried out on Ammassalik Island and at the Mittivakkat Glacier. In 1970 a permanent field station, the Sermilik Research Station, was established, to provide a logistic base for the ongoing glaciological, hydrological, and geomorphological investigations of the Mittivakkat Glacier and its catchment. In 1993, an automatic meteorological station was established at a nunatak situated close to the equilibrium line of the Mittivakkat Glacier to study the glacier climate (515 m a.s.l.). In 1997, a second meteorological station was established, to study the climate in the coastal region. A third meterological station was established at about 200 m a.s.l. in 2009, comprising data on short wave incoming radiation, temperature, relative humidity, wind (direction and speed), and precipitation. The main building of the station is an insulated wooden house of 60 m2 with three rooms for scientists, a dining room, a living room, a kitchen, a toilet, and a storage room. A second, non-insulated building of 50 m2 holds workshop, equipment, generator, a rubber boat, as well as optional accommodation for four persons in a separate room. The station buildings allow for accommodation of 6-10 researchers. During student summer field courses a tent camp is established at the station.","The station supports a comprehensive year-round monitoring programme covering basic climatology and local climate gradients in the Mittivakkat Glacier drainage basin, glacier mass balance, run-off and sediment transport, and the development of coastal and delta geomorphology. Data are available on request from the three climate stations and a hydrometric station. Glacier mass-balance measurements and glacier surveys has been carried out since the mid 1980s and delta surveys since 1989. Maps, digital 3D terrain models, satellite data, and aerial photographs, in addition to a complete bibliography of publications arising from research at the Sermilik Research Station are available on request. ","More than half of the population of East Greenland (c. 3000 inhabitants) live in the town Tasiilaq (c. 1700 inhabitants) which is located 20 km south of the research station. Even though the traditional Inuit culture still plays a major role in daily life, Tasiilaq is also a modern community. Fishing, hunting, service industries, and tourism are the major businesses in the town. The Ammassalik Island and the valleys behind the town have a unique flora and are popular places for hiking.","The Sermilik Research Station can be reached by commercial air carrier via Island to Kulusuk Airport (Greenland Air or charter flights) followed by a helicopter flight to Tasiilaq. From Tasiilaq to the station a boat or a helicopter charter is recommended depending on the weather, snow, or ice conditions, and the amount of luggage/cargo. It is also possible to reach the station after a 15-20 km hike.

It is facing the Disko Bay/Davis Strait and is characterised by a low arctic, coastal climate. Some of the worlds largest icebergs drift by the Arctic Station .","The surroundings of Arctic Station are characterised by a large variety in landscape, flora, and fauna. The station and the nearby town Qeqertarsuaq are situated on a ridge of Precambrian gneisses overlain by massive basalts from the Tertiary. The surrounding mountains have an altitude of 600-800 m a.s.l. Three major valley glaciers, Lyngmarksbræen, Chamberlains Glacier, and Petersens Glacier, can be visited on a single day trip. The area around Qeqertarsuaq is situated in the transition zone between continuous and discontinuous permafrost. A large variety of periglacial phenomena can be studied, i.e. ice- and sand wedges, stone polygons, mud circles, as well as palsa and pingo formations. The coastline is situated only 300 m south of the station along a 100 m wide sandy coastal barrier. The vegetation within the immediate surroundings of the Arctic Station is unique to low arctic Greenland. This is illustrated by the number of species of flowering plants within walking distance from the station: 212 of the 513 Greenlandic flower species occur in the area. This plant diversity is caused by a relatively favourable local climate, a high altitudinal gradient, rich soils, and several homothermic springs.","The botanist Morten Petersen Porsild founded the Arctic Station (Den Danske Arktiske Station) in 1906. The locality selected was c. 1 km east of the town Qeqertarsuaq (formerly Godhavn) which is located on the south coast of the Disko Island  also named Qeqertarsuaq. The idea of establishing an arctic research facility in Greenland was supported by famous explorers of the northern polar regions, e.g. Knud Rasmussen, Ludwig Mylius-Erichsen, and Fridtjof Nansen. The University of Copenhagen became the owner of the research facility in 1953. Arctic Station has around 150 Danish and international visitors, students, and researchers each year. Arctic Station has rooms for 26 people. Kitchen, living room, seminar room, scientific library, and laboratories are found at the station.","The surroundings of Arctic Station offer both terrestrial and marine environments, which makes the research station ideal for botanists, zoologists, geologists, geophysicists, and physical geographers. A meteorological station was established in 1990, and a full record of climate data exists since 1991. These monitoring data are available through Dr. Birger Ulf Hansen, University of Copenhagen, Institute for Geology and Geography (buh@ign.ku.dk).","Arctic Station is located only 1 km east of the town Qeqertarsuaq (Godhavn) with a population of around 1000 inhabitants. The city was established in 1773 by Sven Sandgren. Whaling has always been very important for the city. Fishing and hunting are still among the primary occupations for the islands inhabitants. Tourism is another major business. As something quite unique for Greenland, it is possible to ride a dog sledge on the local glaciers at Qeqertarsuaq under the midnight sun during summer. One can hike to the top of the Lyngmarksfjeld where efforts are rewarded by a fantastic view of Disko Bay and the gigantic icebergs at Ilulissat Icefjord almost 100 kilometres away.","The Arctic Station can be visited without problems throughout the year. Qeqertarsuaq Heliport is served in winter by the Bell 212 helicopter. Air Greenland operates winter-only air services from Qeqertarsuaq Heliport to Ilulissat, Qasigiannguit, and Aasiaat. During summer and autumn, when the waters of Disko Bay are ice-free, transport between towns and settlements is by sea only. A ferry (Diskoline) links Qeqertarsuaq with Ilulissat, Aasiaat, and Qasigiannguit. For further information see www.diskoline.gl.

A small field station is situated in Kobbefjord (64°08 N, 51°23 W), c. 20 km southeast of Nuuk.","GINR and the Kobbefjord field station provide access to a low arctic ecosystem in West Greenland with different biotopes such as dwarf-shrub heaths, fens, grasslands, and lakes. Monitoring of a variety of parameters on vegetation, arthropods, mammals (both terrestrial and marine), birds, freshwater lakes, and the marine environment has been carried out at GINR for several years.","GINR was founded in 1995 (preceded by Greenland Fisheries Research; established in 1946), and the main building was inaugurated in 1998. The main building houses c. 3000 m2 of facilities necessary for the Institutes activities, i.e. offices, laboratories, deep-freeze rooms, storage, conference room, and meeting rooms. Adjacent to the main building is an 850 m2 annex with a large multi-room used for meetings and seminars. Furthermore, the annex has five apartments and eight rooms for visiting researchers, as well as a garage/storage room. GINR has a third building near the city centre of Nuuk with furnished guest rooms for students and visiting scientists. In addition to the buildings in Nuuk, GINR owns two field stations, one in Kobbe­fjord, near Nuuk, and another in Niaqornat, in the Uummannaq area, Northwest Greenland. These field stations function as bases for small research teams and accommodates four people each. GINR also owns two ships, Sanna and Pâmiut, which are used for scientific investigations in both sheltered and open waters. Also, the institute has several small boats and aluminium dinghies. For transport on land, GINR owns three cars and several snowmobiles. ","Research and monitoring activities focus on living marine resources (fish, shellfish, marine mammals, and birds), land-based resources (land mammals and vegetation), as well as physical and chemical processes in the environment in relation to Climate Change and its impact on society. Population assessments and management advice are produced and reviewed in scientific committees under various international bodies where GINR is represented. GINR takes part in the monitoring programme Greenland Ecosystem Monitoring (www.g-e-m.dk). The objective is to provide long-term data series of the natural innate oscillations and plasticity of arctic ecosystems. This is accomplished through monitoring of selected biotic parameters and elements throughout the year on a long-term basis. Data from the monitoring is provided free of charge.","GINR is located in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, with c. 16000 inhabitants. GINR actively communicates with users of the environment (fishermen, hunters, and recreational users) and with direct recipients of scientific advice (e.g. politicians). Users of the environment and their comprehensive knowledge of the natural environment are included during planning and implementation of the institutes activities. Fishing and hunting is part of the traditional culture and is still practiced professionally and for recreational purposes.","Nuuk can be reached by air either via Kangerlussuaq, West Greenland (www.airgreenland.com) or via Reykjavik, Iceland (www.airiceland.is).

","The landscape around the station is dominated by Fjells (mountains or high plateaus above the tree line) extending into the Scandinavian mountain range, e.g. Fjell Saana (1029 m a.s.l.) and Pikku-Malla (738 m a.s.l.). The research station lies c.100 km north of continuous coniferous forest and belongs to the sub-alpine birch forest zone, with mountain birch being the dominant plant species. The area is dominated by a wide range of ecosystems from mountain birch forest at low altitude (480-600 m) to alpine tundra (above 600 m). The majority of the area is a mosaic of treeless alpine heath and ponds. Due to the calcareous bedrock, the Kilpisjärvi area is a hotspot for many calcophilic and endangered mountain plant species. As a consequence, the lepidofauna in this area is exceptionally diverse (more than 340 species are recorded). The Kilpisjärvi region is also famous for rich avifauna of northern and mountainous species, like the bluethroat (Luscinia svecica), the ring ouzel (Turdus torquatus), and the dotterel (Charadrius morinellus). The Norwegian lemming (Lemmus lemmus) is the most characteristic mammal species. ","The station with its four buildings was officially opened in 1964. In the main building, there are two lecture halls (with space for either 30 or 60 people, one of which also serves as dining room), computer room, library, kitchen, and laboratory facilities. Laboratories have a supply of electricity, gas, compressed air, and running water, and are equipped with refrigerator, ovens, freezers, spectrophotometer, micro- and macro-scales, microscopes, centrifuge, pH- and conductivity meters, thermometers, etc. Also a wide variety of field equipment is available, together with boats and snowmobiles. Ars Bioarctica bioart laboratory is affiliated to the station (http://bioartsociety.fi/ars-bioarctica). The library contains a collection of zoological, botanical, geographical, and statistical handbooks. Telephone, fax, copy machines, and computers with access to internet are provided. WLAN is accessible in the station area. The accommodation capacity is about 50 persons, and meals are served daily at the station. There is a permanent staff of eight persons. ","Widely respected long-term follow-up studies form the core of the scientific activities at the station. The longest observation series (>50 years) are on fluctuations of small rodent densities. Population dynamics of passerines have been monitored since 1957. Long-term research projects also include the periodicity in quality and quantity of vegetation in the mountain region. Effects of environmental changes have been monitored for instance in the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX). The specific long-term studies are backed by more extensive studies on climate, vegetation, soils, rodents, birds, predators, etc. Limnology is a rising branch of research. Lately research activities have extended from animal and botanical ecology to hydrobiological and paleolimnological research. Projects such as MOLAR, CHILL, LAPBIAT, and SCANNET have been carried out in Kilpisjärvi in addition to regular studies on geography and geophysics. The Kilpisjärvi Biological Station is the Finnish representative in the ITEX-project. Since 2007 the station has been part of the Finnish Northern LTSER program, in which data from long-term follow-up studies will be organised and digitized in an EU-funded LTER-project. A bibliography of publications arising from research at the station is available. There is an also an extensive collection of climate records and biological data on plants and animals available from the station. The station publishes its own newsletter Kilpisjärvi Notes.","Reindeer husbandry, tourism, and research dominate in the area. Recent construction and development plans in the village may pose a threat for the future of some of the long-term studies. ","The station is easily accessible by air or bus (via Rovaniemi).

The station connects different monitoring infrastructures in the region. Qaanaaq is a modern Greenlandic town located some distance away from the National Park in NOrth East Greenland and the nature reserve area in the Melville Bay to the south. Still, in particular marine activities are regulated in order not to disturb the Narwhal during summer. The city of Qaanaaq is located on a small peninsula at the northern flank of the deep Inglefield Fjord. A number of glaciers terminate into the fjord and the prominent North Water Winter Polynya reach to the mouth of the fjord. Qaanaaq connects a number of small settlements in the region.","Qaanaaq has a cold, dry, tundra climate with running water only during four months a year. The peninsula is covered by a small local ice cap, the Qaanaaq ice cap. The city is based on permafrost and the fjord is covered by land fast ice from December through June.  In summer, Inglefield Fjord is a key habitat for Narwhal and activities in the region includes extensive winter fishing for halibut and hunting of walrus. Musk ox and reindeer populate nearby areas and the surrounding waters (including the productive North-Water polynia) support whales, seals, ploar bears and numerous birdspecies including guillemots and large populations of litle auks (millions).",The DMI Geophysical Observatory Qaanaaq Station was established in the 1950s and has a local full time manager year round. The main station includes a small workshop but at present no lab facilities. It has an apartment for 2-4 with kitchen and shower. The station meets local standards and stays open year round though some upgrades are planned during the coming years. Internet access and telephone is available and the local manager has a pick-up van.,"In addition to classical meteorological measurements, it has served as a multidisciplinary Geophysical Observatory. Ongoing monitoring today includes infrasound and geomagnetism. In the latter years DMI has developed a participatory ocean and cryosphere monitoring program with offset in the station in collaboration with local hunters and with focus on the winter season. Monitoring data are presently only available from DMI data bases. ","Qaanaaq is a modern Greenlandic town (ca. 500 inhabitants) where subsistence hunting and fishing is an important part of the local economy. Qaanaaq is the gateway to a number of smaller settlements both north and south of the town.

Melrakkaslétta is the northern most lowland area in Iceland, only 3 km south of the Arctic Circle. The northern part of the peninsula is an important area for conservation and is listed as an internationally Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdlLife International. ","Low average summer temperature and high humidity affect the areas vegetation, which is classified as Low-Arctic. Freshwater lakes, some with arctic charr and brown trout, are abundant. The coast is characterized by algae rich, gentle sloping gravel banks with numerous open and land-locked bays, inlets, salt marshes, and brackish lagoons. At least 53 species of birds have been found nesting in the area, some in very high densities such as the Rock ptarmigan and purple sandpiper. The nutrient rich shoreline is used by locally breeding seabirds, waterfowl and waders, as well as up to 20,000 arctic waders on their way to their breeding grounds in Greenland and Arctic Canada. Three mammal species occur in Melrakkaslétta; the arctic fox, american mink and wood mouse.","Rif Field Station was established in 2014. Currently housed in a three-floor building partly run as a guesthouse, it can accommodate up to 20 people. 1 to 4-person bedrooms are available with access to shared bathrooms, kitchen, living room and storage facilities.  Laboratory facilities are housed within the local school (5 min walk). All necessary services can be found within Raufarhöfn, including a grocery store, bank, post office, health care centre, restaurant, coffee shop and a swimming pool. The station has unlimited access to the land of Rif, the northernmost part of Iceland, for scientific purposes.","Rif Field Station is in its development stage and is in the process of implementing long-term terrestrial and freshwater monitoring. Research includes basic monitoring projects on weather/climate change, vegetation, freshwater, arthropods and birds. Long-term research in the area includes arctic bird species such as rock ptarmigan, gyrfalcon, and purple sandpiper. In 2018, Rif installed a climate station collecting data on various weather parameters, soil temperature and moisture as well as NDVI. Sensors measuring water temperature and conductivity will be added in 2020. Climate data from the region dates back to 1920 and arrival dates for various bird species have been registered since 2001.","Historically, most of Melrakkaslétta was used for sheep farming, supplemented with small scale fishing, both at sea and in freshwater lakes. The large amount of driftwood that washes up on the shore has also been of significant value. Today most of these farms have been abandoned, although some are still used as summer houses. Down is still collected in the peninsulas large eider colonies.The village of Raufarhöfn (180 inhabitants), with its great natural harbour, was established for fishery.

","Summit Station (72°36 N, 38°25 W), is a research platform locat­ed near the summit of the Greenland ice sheet at an altitude of 3210 m a.s.l. It is located within Greenlands North-East National Park which protects the inland ice and glaciers issuing therefrom as well as adjoining coastal land areas. ","Located near the summit of the Greenland ice sheet, Summit Stations
location features ease of access to a high elevation, high latitude and low water vapor location that allows researchers to measure components of the earth system that would otherwise not be accessible. The facility is currently the highest elevation research station located north of the Arctic Circle. ","Summit Station began as the base camp for the drilling of the GISP2 ice core in 1989. Since then, the station has hosted both summer campaign science and, since 1997, year-round monitor­ing observations of cryospheric processes, both chemical and physical. After the initial experimental winter seasons in 1997-98 and 2000-2002, the station has been continuously occupied since 2003. The station consists of three primary structures, with tem­porary shelters erected seasonally. It serves a seasonal population of up to 50 staff and researchers during the months of April-Au­gust, with a skeleton staff of 5 for the remainder of the year.","A wide variety of research projects have been conducted at Sum­mit since 1989. Initially established as a camp for the collection of the Greenland Ice Sheet Project II (GISP2) ice core, seasonal campaigns were established to measure atmospheric com­ponents to improve the interpretation of the ice core records. The value of the location was readily recognised and further intensive measurement campaigns were initiated on a seasonal basis. Since that time Summit Station has become an Arctic flag­ship station as part of the Arctic Observing Network (AON) and the International Arctic Systems for Observing the Atmosphere (IASOA) network. The Greenland Environmental Observatory at Summit (GEOSummit) was established in response to a demand for a facility capable of providing year-round resources and support for research on the summit of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Project summaries, a list of publications and contacts by which to access Summit-derived datasets can be found at the GEO­Summit website www.geosummit.org.",The nearest local community of Ilulissat is 593 km west of Sum­mit with approximately 4500 inhabitants of Greenlandic descent. Summit Station cooperates with other field stations in the area such as the Danish East Greenland Ice Core Project (EGRIP) and many international research institutes. ,"Access is provided via Kangerlussuaq, Greenland, on Hercules LC-130 aircraft operated by the New York Air National Guard 109th Airlift Wing (NYANG-109) and/or ski-equipped Twin Otter flights operated by Norland Air that utilize a 4877 m groomed ski-way for on-site flight operations. The station can also be accessed over­land but not typically used as means of general transportation. The Greenland Inland Traverse (GrIT) follows a roughly 1200 km route from the Thule Air Base, carrying fuel and cargo that reduces the use of aircraft. This also reduces cost to the program and aircraft emissions at Summit Station, a clean air/clean snow research site.","www.geosummit.org, www.summitcamp.org",Greenland,"1989 (open seasonally), 2003 (open year-round)",Year-round,"Yes, must comply with Government of Greenland requirements","Depends on type of study, location and other factors",Jason Buenning jason@polarfield.com; Science Coordination Office sco@summitcamp.org,US National Science Foundation (NSF),US Government,"CH2M Hill Polar Services (CPS), contractor to NSF",Jason Buenning jason@polarfield.com; Science Coordination Office sco@summitcamp.org; Renee Crain at NSF rcrain@nsf.gov,"www.nsf.gov, www.cpspolar.com, www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/obop/sum/, armap.org",NOAA Earth Systems Research Laboratory,USA,"72°35N, 38°25W",72.583333,-38.416667,NA,3210 m a.s.l.,3210 m a.s.l.,3210 m a.s.l.,Ilulissat (4500 inhabitants) and Kangerlussuaq (550 inhabitants),593 km and 700 km,"Aerial image, satellite image, Google Earth",High Arctic, (located on permanent ice cap),2003-present (NOAA baseline measurements),-31 °C,-42 °C,-12 °C,4.1 m/s,36+ m/s,SSW,650 mm,Snow,,758 m2,"Temporary Atmospheric Watch Observatory 17 m2, Mobile Science Facility 48 m2, plus 47 m2 in operational buildings.","Big House 143 m2, Science and Operations Building 264 m2, Greenhouse 200 m2, Berthing Module 35 m2, Smobile 51 m2","1 kitchen/dining/meeting space, 3 offices, 4 laboratories, 8 berthing rooms, 3 bathrooms, 1 living room, 1 infirmary",15/5,34,Yes,Yes,110 V,24 hours per day,"Instrumentation includes aerosol and trace gas sampling, cloud radar, lidars, sodar and radiometers, broadband and UV solar radiometers, interferometer, ceilometer, anemometers, temperature and humidity sensors, barometers and precision GPS base station","Two year-round science technicians staffed by NSF, one by NOAA",Standard,Yes (staffed with paramedic April-August),1 paramedic April-August. 2-6 staff with Wilderness First Responder certification year-round,1080 km to Nuuk,"On station equipment: Satellite phone, VHF radio, HF radio and well stocked medic station, incl. high altitude gamow bag","In field: Satellite phone, VHF radio, medical kit, survival kits",5120 m × 61 m.

The scientific reference area is a 50 by 50 km square with the station in the centre. The station is on the centre axis of the North East Greenland Ice Stream (NEGIS), 480 km from Danmarkshavn, 690 km from Ittoqqortoormiit and 350 km NNE of Summit Station. Due to its location in the ice stream, the sta­tion moves 50 m NNE per year.","Landscape is flat and white with only slight variations in altitude in the vicinity of the station. The annual aver­age temperature is around -28 °C and annual snowfall is around 100 mm water equivalent. Temperatures above 0 °C are extremely rare. Birds (geese, seagulls and finches) are the only observed life forms migrating across the Ice Cap. ","The station was established in 2015 when the former NEEM ice core drilling station was towed by tractor 465 km to EGRIP. The station has a capacity for 25 (peak 40) residents and there is a doctor, a cook and mechanics on site. The station facilities include kitchen, dining area, bath room, laundry, lounge, elec­tronics workshop, office space with internet, sickbay and flight operations office, carpenters workshop, mechanics workshop and storage. Vehicles at the station include tracked vehicles, snowmobiles and snow throwers. There is also an underground drilling and science area with snow caves and connecting tun­nels. Access to underground areas is by elevators and stairs. ","Main research fields are deep ice coring and ice core analysis. Studies of processes at the base of the ice stream and of surface snow composition are also conducted at the station together with weather observations and studies using airborne radar, GPS network, seismic sensors and other geophysical methods.

,,NA,NA,NA,87,Faroe Islands Nature Investigation (FINI),The Faroe Islands Nature Investigation (FINI) belongs to Jarðfeingi (Faroese Earth and Energy Directorate) and partners.,FINI comprises a growing number of monitoring sites placed on public and private land in the Faroe Islands. The 18 islands form a self-governing country under the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Denmark. The total area is approximately 1400 km2 and has a population of almost 50000 people (2010). The monitoring sites are placed on mountain slopes and summits that are accessible within an hour hike from the road and within an hour drive by car from the capital Tórshavn. ,"The Faroe Islands are a group of islands situated between the Norwegian Sea and the northeast Atlantic Ocean with more than 300 km distance to the next land area (approximately half way between Scotland and Iceland). The islands have an oceanic subarctic climate and are characterised by a high relief. The mountain areas are heavily grazed by sheep. The floral and faunal biodiversity is low, reflecting the isolated location, the extreme oceanic climate, the steep topography, and intensive land use. The most dominant vegetation in the Faroe Islands is grassland, found from sea level to the mountain tops. Racomitrium heaths and fell-field vegetation dominate the alpine vegetation. Calluna heaths are common in the lowlands. Birds dominate the terrestrial wild life. ","Most of the monitoring sites of FINI are less than 10 years old. FINI has no station facilities at the sites, but can offer office facilities including internet access, other logistic support, and advice at FINI, Jarðfeingi, in Tórshavn.","The research at the FINI sites focuses on geohazards, meteorology, geophysics, and plant ecology. The existing database includes a bibliography of publications based on monitoring data.","People in towns and villages live a modern European life. Houses are modern, the infrastructure is well developed and it is easy to travel by car. At the same time rich elements of traditional Faroese culture are deeply rooted in daily life: fishing, bird and whale hunting, traditional food and singing, and chain dancing. The language is Faroese which has close roots in the Old Norse language.","You can arrive to the Faroe Islands all year by ship or by plane. The ferry leaves from Hanstholm, Denmark and Seyðisfjørður, Iceland. Look for www.smyrilline.com. Flight connections to the Faroe Islands leave from Copenhagen (Denmark), Aalborg (Denmark), Billund (Denmark), Reykjavik (Iceland), Bergen (Norway), London (UK) and Barcelona (Spain).

,,NA,NA,NA,88,Cairngorms,"The ECN Cairngorms site is owned by Scottish National Heritage, a Scottish government funded body that looks after Scotlands landscapes whilst research is managed by Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. ECN stands for the UK Environmental Change Network, and is the UKs long-term environmental monitoring and research programme. The ECN makes regular measurements of air, soil, water, and a range of animals and plants across a network of sites to determine how and why the natural environment is changing (see www.ecn.ac.uk for more information). ","The ECN Cairngorms site is a north facing granite catchment overlain with peat situated in the Cairngorms Mountains of Scotland (57°07 N, 03°49 W), rising from about 350 m a.s.l. through the tree line at 500 m a.s.l. to the highest summit at 1111 m a.s.l. The catchment area is 10 km2. The site is part of the Invereshie and Inshriach National Nature ­Reserve, and forms part of the Cairngorms National Park. ","The catchment is composed of a wide range of ecosystems from pine forest at low altitude, through bog communities on ground with impeded drainage, to alpine vegetation including moss and lichen heaths on the highest ground. The charismatic capercaillie, a member of the grouse family (IUCN Red listed), is found in the pine woods along with pine martin. Several species of deer can be found grazing a variety of habitats from the forests to the summits. The site has virtually no natural tree line due to past overgrazing but is now being extensively re-colonised by Pinus sylvestris. ","From the middle of the nineteenth century the site was mainly used as deer forest, as part of a large sporting estate in private ownership (Invereshie Estate). It became part of the Cairngorms National Nature Reserve in 1954. Ecological and environmental research has been undertaken in the area since the early 1960s, and the site joined the Environmental Change Network of the UK in 1998. There are no buildings on the site, but accommodation for a small number of visitors can be arranged on site (camping), and there are local hotels and guest houses nearby. ","Research on the site includes both terrestrial and freshwater environmental monitoring as part of the ECN and also as part of the Austrian GLORIA programme (www.gloria.ac.at), examining temperature effects on vegetation across Alpine Europe. Intensive hydrological and snow related research took place in the early 1990s. The Cairngorms area has been the focus of many land use change and tourism impact studies since c. the 1980s, and the data is being used in current ecosystem service research. ","The research site is uninhabited and used for recreation; hiking, trekking, and mountain biking. Aviemore, the nearest town, has a population of around 2500 and became one of the first skiing resorts to be established in Scotland with the opening of the chairlift in 1961. The resort has since grown into the UKs most visited ski resort during the winter months. In 2013 the national park became the first Long-Term Social-Ecological Research (LTSER) platform in the UK, providing a platform for linking ecological, social and economic research.","The research site is close to Aviemore, which has good rail and bus services to Edinburgh (approximately 3 hours) and Inverness (less than an hour).
